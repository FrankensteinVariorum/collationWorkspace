# Welcome to the collationWorkspace for the Frankenstein Variorum Project!
We're glad you're here to help the project and see how collation works! 

Before you can begin collating, we need to verify that you have the following installed on your computer:

* A version of Python 3. 
    * To see if you have python installed and which version, type this in your Git Bash shell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac):
       `python --version`
     If you think you have multiple versions of python installed, try 
       `which -a python`
