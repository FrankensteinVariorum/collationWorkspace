# Welcome to the collationWorkspace for the Frankenstein Variorum Project!

We're glad you're here to help the project and see how collation works! You're helping us with collating five versions of the novel *Frankenstein: or The Modern Prometheus* by Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley. Computationally-assisted collation involves running programs that help mark moments when different versions of a text run the same together and when they diverge from each other. Our collation process produces data about these moments and outputs them in XML that we use to build our Variorum edition of the novel, designed to show "hotspots" of change as you read each version. We are collating five versions of this novel: 

1. Manuscript notebooks written in 1816
2. 1818 first printed edition (published anonymously)
3. Thomas edition (a copy of the printed 1818 edition in which Mary Shelley and possibly others handwrote notes, marked passages to delete, and wrote in passages to add to a possible new edition of the novel. When she traveled back to England after the death of her husband, Mary Shelley left this marked copy of the novel in Italy with a friend, "Mrs. Thomas", who was remaining there--so that is why this is called the Thomas copy. We do not know its exact dates--when the markings were made on the print edition. But we know it was sometime in 1818 or after and sometime before 1824. 
4. 1823 printed edition: prepared by Mary Shelley's father William Godwin. This edition lightly edits but seems not to change the content very much from 1818. This is the first edition to publish Mary Shelley's name as the author.
5. 1831 printed edition: This is a heavily revised version of the novel, with revisions by Mary Shelley but without access to the Thomas copy. 

## Installations needed



Before you can begin collating, we need to verify that you have the following installed on your computer:

* A version of Python 3. 
    * To see if you have python installed and which version, type this in your Git Bash shell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac):
     
          python --version
          
     If you think you have multiple versions of python installed, try 
      
           which -a python
           
* If you do not have Python installed on your system, or if the version number is 2 (as in 2.7), then you need to install Python 3. 
* If you need to install Python 3, here is some guidance for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems: 


Visit the Python website at https://www.python.org/ and look for the **latest Stable Release for your operating system** at
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Windows Users:

Follow steps 1 - 4 on this site, and (IMPORTANT!) **make sure you add Python 3 to your PATH variable!** : https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-python-on-windows-10-and-11 . (You don't need to go on and install Mu, etc. Adding Python to your PATH should mean this is the version of Python that will engage when you run our scripts, and it will also make it easier to access in software when you need to write Python yourself.)
_Just in case we need them_, here are super detailed instructions from Python 
because Windows can be complicated: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html

### Mac Users:

Super informative instructions here: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/installing-python-on-mac/.
Download the latest stable version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/Links to an external site.

### Linux Users? 
Let me know if you use Linux and we'll find some guidance if you need it!

## How to proceed

### Getting to know your "chunk"
You will be assigned a collation unit (or units) to help with collating. These units are commonly known as "chunks" and they are numbered from 1 to 33. Each "chunk" represents a unit about the size of a chapter in the novel. Usually "chunks" are chapters, but sometimes they are parts of chapters in the novel. Each "chunk" is a unit in which all five versions of the novel *Frankenstein* line up with each other, so we know they start and end in very much the same way. 

Here is the process you'll be following.
