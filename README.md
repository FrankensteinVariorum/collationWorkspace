# Welcome to the collationWorkspace for the Frankenstein Variorum Project!
We're glad you're here to help the project and see how collation works! 

Before you can begin collating, we need to verify that you have the following installed on your computer:

* A version of Python 3. 
    * To see if you have python installed and which version, type this in your Git Bash shell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac):
     
          python --version
          
     If you think you have multiple versions of python installed, try 
      
           which -a python
           
* If you do not have Python installed on your system, or if the version number is 2 (as in 2.7), then you need to install Python 3. 
* If you need to install Python 3, here is some guidance for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems: 


Visit the Python website at https://www.python.org/ and look for the **latest Stable Release for your operating system** at
https://www.python.org/downloads/

###Windows Users:

Follow steps 1 - 4 on this site, and (IMPORTANT!) **make sure you add Python 3 to your PATH variable!** : https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-python-on-windows-10-and-11 . (You don't need to go on and install Mu, etc. Adding Python to your PATH should mean this is the version of Python that will engage when you run our scripts, and it will also make it easier to access in software when you need to write Python yourself.)
_Just in case we need them_, here are super detailed instructions from Python 
because Windows can be complicated: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html

###Mac Users:

Super informative instructions here: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/installing-python-on-mac/.
Download the latest stable version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/Links to an external site.

###Linux Users? 
Let me know if you use Linux and we'll find some guidance if you need it!
