# Notes

* Migrated the MS portion of MS5 
* 2023-07-19 ebb: Corrected up to "When I was about fourteen / fifteen"

* Check on Chapter II / III break
* Check alignment around "a respite of some weeks" (when Victor finally is off to Ingolstadat)

* MS has a Chap 4! currently aligned to paragraph breaks in other editions.
just before "The next morning I delivered"


* Watch for 1831: "On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit." vs. "paid him a visit the same evening"
