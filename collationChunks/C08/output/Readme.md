# Notes

 * Watch for this longToken: how does it align?
```xml
 <longToken>fancy. I remember, when he was nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which was the
    delight and amazement of all his companions.</longToken>
``` 

* Watch how the collation lines up around long deleted passage in Thomas:
```
<longToken>No youth could have passed more <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_061" n="049"/>happily than
  mine.</longToken> <longToken>My parents were indulgent, and my companions amiable....</longToken>
```
 
* 1831 "it may appear strange" doesn't line up w/ consecutive longTokens. Removing it: check what happens.
 
* Check "most undivided attention" / "undivided attention" passage 
* Reset 1831 longToken to go *inside* the paragraph at "Thus strangely are our souls constructed..."
 
* Check on Chapter II / III break
* Check alignment around "a respite of some weeks" (when Victor finally is off to Ingolstadat)

* MS has a Chap 4! currently aligned to paragraph breaks in other editions.
just before "The next morning I delivered"


* Watch for 1831: "On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit." vs. "paid him a visit the same evening"
