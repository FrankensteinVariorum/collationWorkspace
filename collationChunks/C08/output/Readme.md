# Notes

- [ ] **MS does not align here** Watch how the collation lines up around long deleted passage in Thomas:
```
<longToken>No youth could have passed more <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_061" n="049"/>happily than
  mine.</longToken> <longToken>My parents were indulgent, and my companions amiable....</longToken>
```
Recommend editing by hand.
- [x]  Watch for this longToken: how does it align?
```xml
 <longToken>fancy. I remember, when he was nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which was the
    delight and amazement of all his companions.</longToken>
``` 
 
- [x]  1831 "it may appear strange" doesn't line up w/ consecutive longTokens. Removing it: check what happens.
 
- [x]  Check "most undivided attention" / "undivided attention" passage 
* Reset 1831 longToken to go *inside* the paragraph at "Thus strangely are our souls constructed..."
 
- [x]  Check on Chapter II / III break
- [x]  Check alignment around "a respite of some weeks" (when Victor finally is off to Ingolstadat)

- [x]  MS has a Chap 4! corrected alignment with "The next morning I delivered"

- [x] Corrected: Watch for 1831: "On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit." vs. "paid him a visit the same evening"
