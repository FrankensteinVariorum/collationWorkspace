   <longToken><p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/>Every one loved Elizabeth.</longToken> <longToken>The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which
      all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening
      previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—“I have a
      pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she
      presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,
      interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect,
      love, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_039" n="23"/>cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I
      received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name
      of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she
      stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/> W<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/>E<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/> were brought up together; there was not quite a year
      difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion
      or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast
      that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and
      more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
      application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied
      herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and
      wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains;
      the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and
      turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
     tigating their While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent
      appearances of things, I delighted in inves causes. The world was to me a
      secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws
      of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest
      sensations I can remember.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/></longToken>
   <longToken><p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely
      their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house
      in Geneva, and a <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/>campagne<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/> on Belrive, the eastern shore of the
      lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally
      in the latter, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_040" n="24"/>the lives of my parents were passed
      in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself
      fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I
      united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.</longToken> Henry Clerval
   was the son <longToken>of a merchant of Geneva.</longToken> He was a boy of singular talent and <longToken>fancy. He loved
      enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake.</longToken> He was deeply read in books of
   <longToken>chivalry and romance.</longToken> <longToken>He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of
      enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into
      masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the
      Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the
      holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/><longToken>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.</longToken> <longToken>My parents were
   possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the
      tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all
      the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly
      discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement
      of filial love.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/>
   <longToken><p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my
      temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to
      learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the
      structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,
      possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to
      learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature
      and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the
      metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/></longToken>
   <longToken><p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.
      The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;
      and his hope and his dream was to become one among those <pb xml:id="F1831_v_041" n="25"/>whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our
      species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our
      peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her
      celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of
      love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the
      ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own
      gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet
      he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of
      kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded
      to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of
      his soaring ambition.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before
   misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness
   into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my
   early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale
   of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which
   afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and
   almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in
   its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my <longToken>fate; I desire, therefore,</longToken> in
   this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When
   I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near
   Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In
   this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
   with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which
   he relates, soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon
   my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. <longToken><pb xml:id="F1831_v_042" n="26"/>My father looked carelessly at the titlepage of my book,</longToken>
   and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it
   is sad trash.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the
   principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science
   had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the
   powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical;
   under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and have
   contented my imagination, warmed as it <longToken>was, by returning with greater ardour to my
   former studies.</longToken> It is even possible, that the train of my ideas would never have
   received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had
   taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and
   I continued to read with the greatest avidity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
   afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of
   these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few <longToken>beside myself. I
      have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate
      the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of
      modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir
      Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside
      the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of
      natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions,
      as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their
      practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled
      the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He
      might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in
      their secondary and tertiary grades were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_043" n="27"/>utterly
      unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
      human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had
      repined.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took
      their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.</longToken> It may appear <longToken>strange
   that</longToken> such should arise in the eighteenth century; <longToken>but while I followed the routine of
      education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to
      my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a
      child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my
      new preceptors,</longToken> I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the
   philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my <longToken>undivided
   attention.</longToken> Wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the discovery, if
   I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a
   violent death!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p12"/>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally
   accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if
   my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own
   inexperience <longToken>and mistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity</longToken> in my instructors. <longToken>And
      thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a
      thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately in a very slough of
      multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an
      accident again changed the current of my ideas.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p13"/>When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we
   witnessed <longToken>a most violent and terrible thunder-storm.</longToken> It advanced from behind the
   mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various
   quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with
   curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire
   issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our <pb xml:id="F1831_v_044" n="28"/>house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the
   oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the
   next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by
   the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribands of wood. I never beheld anything so
   utterly destroyed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p13"/>
  <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/><longToken>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this
      occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this
      catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the
      subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.</longToken> <longToken>All
         that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and
         Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men
         disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or
         could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
         By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early
         youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its
         progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a
         would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In
         this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study
         appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of
         my consideration.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/><longToken>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to
      prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change
      of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—            the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then
      hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual
      tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and
      latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
      their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/>
      <pb xml:id="F1831_v_045" n="29"/>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it
      was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
      terrible destruction.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1"/> W<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1_hi1"/>HEN<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1_hi1"/> I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents
            resolved that I should <longToken>become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.</longToken> I had hitherto
            attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion
            of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my
            native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day
            resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it
            were, of my future misery.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p2"/>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet <longToken>fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the
            greatest danger.</longToken> During her illness, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother
            to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but
            when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer <longToken>control
            her anxiety. She attended her sick bed,—her watchful attentions triumphed over the
            malignity of the distemper,—Elizabeth was saved, but</longToken> the consequences of this
            imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever
            was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants
            prognosticated the worst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this
            <longToken>best of women</longToken> did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and <longToken>myself:—“My
            children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect
            of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.</longToken> Elizabeth,
            my love, you must supply my place to <longToken>my younger</longToken> children. Alas! I regret that I am taken
            from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_046" n="30"/>is it
            not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to
            resign myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another
            world.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p3"/>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not
            describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable
            evil; the void that presents itself to the soul; and the despair that is exhibited on
            the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw
            every day, and whose very existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for
            ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished, and the sound of
            a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never more to be heard. These
            are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of
            the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude
            hand rent away some dear connection? and why should I describe a sorrow which all have
            felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence than
            a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed <longToken>a
            sacrilege, is not banished.</longToken> My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought
            to perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think ourselves
            fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again
            determined upon. I <longToken>obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me
            sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to
            rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I
            was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above all, I desired
            to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/><longToken>She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked
            steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to
            those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_047" n="31"/>cousins.</longToken> Never <longToken>was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine
            of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours
            to make us forget.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/>The day of my departure at length arrived. <longToken>Clerval spent the last evening with us.</longToken> <longToken>He
            had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me, and to become my
            fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and
            ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.</longToken> Henry <longToken>deeply felt the misfortune of
            being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he spoke, I read in
            his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be
            chained to the miserable details of commerce.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/>We <longToken>sat late.</longToken> <longToken>We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves
            to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking
            repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn I
            descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
            again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her
            entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her
            playmate and friend.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the most
            melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions,
            continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone. <longToken>In the
            university,</longToken> whither I was going, I must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My
            life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me
            invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval;
            these were “old familiar faces;” but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company
            of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my
            spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often,
            when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place, and had
            longed to enter the world, and take my <pb xml:id="F1831_v_048" n="32"/>station among
            other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been
            folly to repent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to
            Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town
            met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the
            evening as I pleased.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p10"/><longToken>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction,</longToken> and paid a visit to some of
            the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of
            Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my
            reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural
            philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He
            asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science
            appertaining to natural philosophy. <longToken>I replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt,
            mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal authors I had studied.</longToken> The
            professor stared: “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such
            nonsense?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p11"/>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every
            instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have
            burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! in what desert
            land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies,
            which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are
            ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple
            of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely
            anew.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p12"/>So saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural
            philosophy, which he desired me to procure; and dismissed me, after mentioning that in
            the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon
            natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor,
            would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p13"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_049" n="33"/>I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said
            that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor <longToken>reprobated; but I
            returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.</longToken> M. Krempe
            was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher,
            therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too
            philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the
            conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been
            content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a
            confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide
            on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and
            exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists.
            Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very
            different, when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views,
            although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed. The <longToken>ambition of the enquirer</longToken>
            seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
            science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur
            for realities of little worth.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/>Such were my reflections during <longToken>the first two or three days of my residence at
            Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the
            principal residents in my new abode.</longToken> But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
            information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could
            not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences <longToken>out of a
            pulpit,</longToken> I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had
            <longToken>hitherto been</longToken> out of town.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
            M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
            appeared <longToken>about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
            benevolence;</longToken> a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
            were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_050" n="34"/>nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably
            erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a
            recapitulation of the history of chemistry, and the various improvements made by
            different men of <longToken>learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished
            discoverers.</longToken> He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science, and
            explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments,
            he concluded with a panegyric upon <longToken>modern chemistry,</longToken> the terms of which I shall never
            forget:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p16"/>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
            performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
            be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
            hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
            crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature,
            and show how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into <longToken>the heavens:</longToken> they have
            discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have
            acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic
            the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p17"/><longToken>Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to
            destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy;
            one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord
            after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
            one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far
            more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way,
            explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p18"/>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and
            turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By
            degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts
            were as a dream. There only <pb xml:id="F1831_v_051" n="35"/>remained a resolution to
            return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I believed
            myself to possess a natural talent.</longToken> <longToken>On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit.</longToken> His
            manners in private were even more mild <longToken>and attractive than in public;</longToken> for there was a
            certain dignity in his mien during his lecture, <longToken>which in his own house was replaced by
            the greatest affability and kindness.</longToken> <longToken>I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my
            former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor.</longToken> He heard <longToken>with attention the
            little narration concerning my studies, and</longToken> smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and
            Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, that “these
            were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the
            foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new
            names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree
            had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however
            erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of
            mankind.” I listened <longToken>to his statement, which was delivered</longToken> without any presumption or
            affectation; and then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern
            <longToken>chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from
            a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made
            me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested</longToken> his
            advice concerning the books I ought to procure.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p19"/>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application
            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be <longToken>made: it</longToken> is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he
            attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is <longToken>to become really</longToken> a
            man of science, and not merely a petty ex<pb xml:id="F1831_v_052" n="36"/>perimentalist,
            I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including
            mathematics.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p20"/>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his various
            machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and promising me the use of his
            own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their
            mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested; and I took my
            leave.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p21"/>Thus ended a day memorable to <longToken>me; it decided my future destiny.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p21"/><milestone unit="chapter" type="end" n="3"/></longToken>
