   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p1"/>T<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p1_hi1"/>HE<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p1_hi1"/> next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides,
            was fine, although clouded. We visited the source of the Arveiron, and rode about the
            valley until evening. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest
            consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of
            feeling; and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.
            In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_217" n="198"/>brooded for the last month. I returned in the evening,
            fatigued, but less unhappy, and conversed with my family with more cheerfulness than had
            been my custom for some time. My father was pleased, and Elizabeth overjoyed. “My dear
            cousin,” said she, “you see what happiness you diffuse when you are happy; do not
            relapse again!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p2"/>The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits
            of the mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. The rain depressed me; my
            old feelings recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how disappointed my father would be
            at this sudden change, and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered myself so far as
            to be enabled to conceal those feelings that overpowered me. I knew that they would
            remain that day at the inn; <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_218" n="199"/>and as I had ever inured
            myself to rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to go alone to the summit of Montanvert.
            I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had
            produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstacy
            that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and
            joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of
            solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to
            go alone, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would
            destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p3"/>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which
            enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_219" n="200"/>mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the
            winter avelânche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground;
            some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or
            transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
            of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly
            dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a
            concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines
            are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene.
            I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through
            it, and curling in thick wreaths around the oppo<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_220" n="201"/>site
            mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark
            sky, and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas!
            why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only
            renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and
            desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows, and a
            chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p3"/>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p4"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_221" n="202"/>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the
            ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
            both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I
            descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a
            troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice
            is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
            mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was
            exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful
            majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous
            scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_222" n="203"/> 
            whose aërial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
            before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed—“Wandering spirits,
            if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness,
            or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p5"/>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
            towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I
            had walked with caution; his stature also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of
            man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I
            was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came
            nearer, (sight tre<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_223" n="204"/>mendous and abhorred!) that it was
            the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his
            approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance
            bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
            ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this;
            anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to
            overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p6"/>“Devil!” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? and do not you fear the fierce
            vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! or rather stay,
            that I may trample you to <longToken>dust! and, oh,</longToken> that I could, with the extinction of your
            miserable exist<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_224" n="205"/>ence, restore those victims whom you
            have so diabolically murdered!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p7"/>“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the wretched; how then must
            I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and
            spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the
            annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do
            your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you
            will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I
            will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining
            friends.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p8"/>“Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance
            for thy crimes. Wretched <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_225" n="206"/>devil! you reproach me with
            your creation; come on then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently
            bestowed.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p9"/>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm
            one being against the existence of another.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p10"/>He easily eluded me, and said,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p11"/>“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted
            head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it
            may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember,
            thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints
            more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy
            creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_226" n="207"/>lord and king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.
            Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone, to whom
            thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember, that I am thy
            creature: I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest
            from joy for no misdeed. Every where I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably
            excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall
            again be virtuous.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p12"/>“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are
            enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p13"/>“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favour<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_227" n="208"/>able eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness
            and compassion. Believe me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and
            humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can
            I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. The
            desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the
            caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man
            does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your
            fellow-beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you
            do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I
            will keep no terms with my <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_228" n="209"/>enemies. I am miserable,
            and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and
            deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only
            you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of
            its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale: when
            you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But
            hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their
            own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of
            murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh,
            praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me: listen to <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_229" n="210"/>me; and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the
            work of your hands.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14"/>“Why do you call to my <longToken>remembrance,” I rejoined,</longToken> “circumstances, of which I shudder to
            reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred
            devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that
            formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to
            consider whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve me from the sight of your
            detested form.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p15"/>“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes,
            which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.
            Still thou canst listen to me, and grant me thy <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_230" n="211"/>compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my
            tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your
            fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens;
            before it descends to hide itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another
            world, you will have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for
            ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your
            fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy ruin.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p16"/>As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed. My heart was full, and I
            did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had
            used, and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity,
            and compas<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_231" n="212"/>sion confirmed my resolution. I had
            hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a
            confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties
            of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
            complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We
            crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the
            rain again began to descend: we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I
            with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen; and, seating
            myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p16"/>
