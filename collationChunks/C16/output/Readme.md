# Notes:

## 1-27-2023:

* Divergence in 1831 found: need to find starting point, but it's prominent around line 763.

* Simultaneous divergence found in Thomas in line 547. Monitor carefully, changes may not be necessary to Thomas.

## 1-30-2023

* After pretty printing, 1831 starts to diverge around line 473 and continues until line 665. 

* Lines 686 to 699 diverge for 1831, debating if it is too brief to make a longToken for.

* Possible divergence for 1831 spotted at line 772. Next time 1831 appears, some common words are shared, but there are a lot of different phrases and the divergence stops at line 1069.

* After previous note, no divergence until at least line 3000

## 2-1-2023

* **Mental Note:** Search for a phrase rather than a line number when writing up divergences. Pretty print and shell script will cause the numbers to change.

* Have the texts open for side-by-side comparison when planting long tokens.

* Carefully evaluate the manuscript to find long tokens.

* Take note of minor divergences/stacking issues in the manuscript. May be significant.

* Ending point: "Contempt - Devil"

## 2-8-2023

* Manuscript has issues aligning "Dust and Oh." Possibly too short for a longToken.

* Note: reposition longToken for "be calm" in MS

* Finishing Point: "and said- Be calm!"

## 2-12-23

* Trying to adjust the longToken for "and said - be calm!" so it aligns with teh rest of the text in the manuscript. Next note will describe if it works.

* Update: It didn't work. I'm wondering if I have to put the phrase in longTokens across the all the drafts in order for it to align, but I'll wait for evaluation.

* MS: "Although it be only an accumulation of anguish," "be" is detected in every draft except this one. The word is there, don't know why it wasn't detected.

* MS Confusion: The manuscript has "do not be equitable" while every other version has "be not equitable" MS has different word order, but "not" and "be" are isolated from the other drafts. Can't tell if it's supposed to be this way.

* MS: Clemency from "thy clemency and affection". Clemency is grouped with thy rather than with affection. Full statement may be "They clemency, thy affection," But I'm not certain and a misalignment may be possible here.

* MS: "Begone replied I-" properly aligned, but has extra words. Statements afterwards align properly, but write it down anyway. The same applies for "You? said the fiend;" properly aligned, just extra words.

* MS: "Mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do." First "do" is missing in collation despite the phrase being identical in the MS.

* "Bloody as they are" (1823 + 1831), "Bloody as they may be" (1818 + Thomas), "Bloody as they be" (MS). Double-check realignment, token may be necessary. 

* Confusing alignment for a section including remembrance and circumstances. 

* Final note: read through section! Aside from today's notes, not too much revision appears to be necessary.
