# Notes:

## 1-27-2023:

* Divergence in 1831 found: need to find starting point, but it's prominent around line 763.

* Simultaneous divergence found in Thomas in line 547. Monitor carefully, changes may not be necessary to Thomas.

## 1-30-2023

* After pretty printing, 1831 starts to diverge around line 473 and continues until line 665. 

* Lines 686 to 699 diverge for 1831, debating if it is too brief to make a longToken for.

* Possible divergence for 1831 spotted at line 772. Next time 1831 appears, some common words are shared, but there are a lot of different phrases and the divergence stops at line 1069.

* After previous note, no divergence until at least line 3000

## 2-1-2023

* **Mental Note:** Search for a phrase rather than a line number when writing up divergences. Pretty print and shell script will cause the numbers to change.

* Have the texts open for side-by-side comparison when planting long tokens.

* Carefully evaluate the manuscript to find long tokens.

* Take note of minor divergences/stacking issues in the manuscript. May be significant.

* Ending point: "Contempt - Devil"

## 2-8-2023

* Manuscript has issues aligning "Dust and Oh." Possibly too short for a longToken.

* Note: reposition longToken for "be calm" in MS

* Finishing Point: "and said- Be calm!"
