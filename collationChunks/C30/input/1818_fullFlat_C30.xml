   <longToken><head>CHAPTER VI.</head> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p1"/>I<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p1_hi1"/>T<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p1_hi1"/> was eight o’clock</longToken> when we landed; <longToken>we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn,</longToken> and
            contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet
            still displaying their black outlines.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p2"/>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The
            moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to descend; the clouds
            swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_121" n="117"/>the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens,
            rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly <longToken>a heavy storm of rain descended.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p2"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p3"/>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
            thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped
            a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I
            would sell my life dearly, and not relax <longToken>the impending conflict until</longToken> my own life, or
            that of my adversary, were extinguished.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p4"/>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful <longToken>silence; at length she said, “What is it</longToken> that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p5"/>“Oh! peace, peace, my <longToken>love,” re<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_122" n="118"/>plied I, “this night,</longToken> and all will be safe: but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p6"/>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how dreadful the
            combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her
            to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the
            situation of my enemy.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p7"/>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house,
            and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I
            discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance
            had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill
            and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_123" n="119"/>had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed
            into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I
            could feel the blood trickling in my veins, <longToken>and tingling in the extremities of</longToken> my limbs.
            <longToken>This state lasted but for</longToken> an instant; the scream was repeated, <longToken>and I rushed into the room.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p7"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p8"/>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the
            best hope, and the purest creature of earth. She was there, lifeless and inanimate,
            thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half
            covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and
            relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live?
            Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_124" n="120"/>is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fainted.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p9"/>When I recovered, I found myself <longToken>surrounded by the people of the inn;</longToken> their
            countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared only as a
            mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room
            where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.
            She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she
            lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might
            have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the
            <longToken>deathly languor and</longToken> coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had
            ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_125" n="121"/>murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had
            ceased to issue from her lips.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p10"/>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. <longToken>The windows of the room</longToken> had before been darkened; and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale
            yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and,
            with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the
            most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as
            with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the
            window, and drawing a pistol from my <longToken>bosom, shot;</longToken> but he eluded me, leaped from his
            station, and, running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into <longToken>the lake.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p10"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p11"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_126" n="122"/>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the
            room. <longToken>I pointed to the spot</longToken> where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
            boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless,
            most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. After
            having landed, they proceeded to search the <longToken>country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p11"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p12"/>I did not accompany them; I <longToken>was exhausted:</longToken> a film covered my eyes, and my skin was
            parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed, hardly conscious of what
            had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something <longToken>that I had lost.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p12"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p13"/>At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_127" n="123"/>of <longToken>Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought</longToken> tears <longToken>into my eyes, and I wept for a long time;</longToken> <longToken>but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting on</longToken> my misfortunes, and their cause. I
            was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of
            Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not
            that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even
            now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea
            made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to
            Geneva with all <longToken>possible speed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p13"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p14"/>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was
            unfavourable, and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_128" n="124"/>the rain fell in torrents.
            <longToken>However, it was</longToken> hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired
            men to row, and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental
            torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of
            agitation that I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar;
            and, leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I
            looked up, I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I
            had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a
            recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw
            the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been
            observed <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_129" n="125"/>by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to
            the human mind as <longToken>a great and sudden</longToken> change. The sun might shine, or the clouds might
            lour; but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched
            from me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I was;
            so frightful an event is single in the history of man.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p15"/>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event.
            Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p15_hi1"/>acme<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p15_hi1"/>, and
            what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were
            snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in <longToken>a few</longToken> words, what remains of my hideous narration.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p16"/>I arrived at Geneva. My father and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_130" n="126"/>Ernest yet
            lived; but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and
            venerable old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and <longToken>their delight—his niece,</longToken> his more than daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection
            which <longToken>a man feels,</longToken> who, in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more
            earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his
            grey hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors
            that were accumulated around him; <longToken>an apoplectic fit was brought on,</longToken> and in a few days he
            died in my arms.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p17"/>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the
            only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in
            flowery <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_131" n="127"/>meadows and pleasant vales with the
            friends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but
            by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then
            released from my prison. For they had called me mad; and during many months, as I
            understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p18"/>But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the
            same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I
            began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon
            whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening
            rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_132" n="128"/>within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge
            on his cursed head.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p19"/>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best
            means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired
            to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I
            knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority
            for the apprehension of the murderer.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p20"/>The magistrate listened to me with <longToken>attention and kindness: “Be</longToken> assured, sir,” said he,
            “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p21"/>“I thank <longToken>you,” replied I; “listen, therefore,</longToken> to the deposition that I have to make. It
            is indeed a tale so strange, <longToken>that I should</longToken> fear you would not credit <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_133" n="129"/>it, were there not something in truth which, however
            wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and
            I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but
            calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and
            this purpose quieted <longToken>my agony, and provisionally</longToken> reconciled me to life. I now related my
            history briefly, but with firmness and precision, <longToken>marking the</longToken> dates with accuracy, <longToken>and never deviating into invective or exclamation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p21"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p22"/>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became
            more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a
            lively surprise, unmingled with <longToken>disbelief, was painted on his countenance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p22"/> <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_134" n="130"/> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p23"/></longToken>When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This
            is the being whom I accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you to
            exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, <longToken>and I believe and hope that</longToken>
            your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this
            occasion.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p24"/>This address caused a considerable change in the <longToken>physiognomy of my auditor.</longToken> He had
            heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and
            supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the
            whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly
            afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have
            powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_135" n="131"/>Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit
            caves and dens, where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed
            since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has
            wandered, or what region he may now inhabit.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p25"/>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed
            taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of
            prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to
            pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p26"/>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was <longToken>intimidated; “You</longToken> are
            mistaken,” said he, “I will <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_136" n="132"/>exert myself; and if
            it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment
            proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his
            properties, that this will prove impracticable, and that, while every proper measure is
            pursued, <longToken>you should endeavour to</longToken> make up your mind to disappointment.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p27"/>“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no
            moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring
            and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer,
            whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I have
            but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his
            destruction.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p28"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_137" n="133"/>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said
            this; there was a phrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty
            fierceness, which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
            magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and
            heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to
            soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects of
            delirium.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p29"/>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what
            it is you say.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p30"/>I broke from the house <longToken>angry and disturbed,</longToken> and retired to meditate on <longToken>some other mode of action.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div24_p30"/></longToken>
