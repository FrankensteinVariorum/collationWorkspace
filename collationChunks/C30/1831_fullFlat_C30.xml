   <longToken><head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p1"/>I<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p1_hi1"/>T<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p1_hi1"/> was eight o’clock</longToken> when we landed; <longToken>we walked for a short
            time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn,</longToken> and
            contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet
            still displaying their black outlines.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p2"/>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The
            moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to descend; the clouds
            swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the
            lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless
            waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly <longToken>a heavy storm of rain descended.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p2"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p3"/>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
            thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped
            a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I
            would sell my life dearly, and not shrink from the conflict until my own life, or that
            of my adversary, was extinguished.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p4"/>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful <longToken>silence; but there
            was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling she asked,
               “What is it</longToken> that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p5"/>“Oh! peace, peace, my <longToken>love,” replied I; “this night,</longToken> and all will be safe: but this
            night is dreadful, very dreadful.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p6"/>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the
            combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her
            to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the
            situation of my enemy.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p7"/>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house,
            and inspecting every corner <pb xml:id="F1831_v_191" n="175"/>that might afford a
            retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to
            conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his
            menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into
            which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms
            dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
            trickling in my veins, <longToken>and tingling in the extremities of</longToken> my limbs. <longToken>This state lasted
            but for</longToken> an instant; the scream was repeated, <longToken>and I rushed into the room.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p7"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p8"/>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the
            best hope, and the purest creature of earth? She was there, lifeless and inanimate,
            thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half
            covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and
            relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live?
            Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only
            did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p9"/>When I recovered, I found myself <longToken>surrounded by the people of the inn;</longToken> their
            countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared only as a
            mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room
            where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.
            She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she
            lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might
            have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the
            <longToken>deadly languor and</longToken> coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had
            ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the
            fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p10"/>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. <longToken>The windows
            of the room</longToken> had before <pb xml:id="F1831_v_192" n="176"/>been darkened, and I felt a
            kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The
            shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be described, I
            saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of
            the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the
            corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my <longToken>bosom,
            fired;</longToken> but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the swiftness of
            lightning, plunged into <longToken>the lake.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p10"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p11"/>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. <longToken>I pointed to the spot</longToken> where he
            had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.
            After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing <longToken>it to
            have been a form conjured up</longToken> by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search
            the <longToken>country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p11"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p12"/>I attempted to accompany <longToken>them, and proceeded a short distance from the house; but my
            head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man,</longToken> I fell at last in a state
            of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of
            fever. In this state I was carried back, and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what
            had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something <longToken>that I had
            lost.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p12"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p13"/>After an interval, I arose, and, as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the
            corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around—I hung over it, and joined my
            sad tears to theirs—all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind; <longToken>but my
            thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on</longToken> my misfortunes, and their
            cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the
            execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment
            I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my
            father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.
            This idea made me shudder, and re<pb xml:id="F1831_v_193" n="177"/>called me to action.
            I started up, and resolved to return to Geneva with all <longToken>possible speed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p13"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p14"/>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was
            unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. <longToken>However, it was</longToken> hardly morning, and I might
            reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and took an oar myself; for I
            had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the
            overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered me
            incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and leaning my head upon my hands, gave
            way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw the scenes which were
            familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had contemplated but the day before in
            the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my
            eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they
            had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so
            painful to the human mind as <longToken>a great and sudden</longToken> change. The sun might shine, or the
            clouds might lower: but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A
            fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so
            miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p15"/>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?
            Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p15_hi1"/>acme<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p15_hi1"/>, and
            what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were
            snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in <longToken>a
            few</longToken> words, what remains of my hideous narration.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p16"/>I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived; but the former sunk under the
            tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered
            in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and <longToken>their delight—his Elizabeth,</longToken> his more than
            daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection which <longToken>a man feels,</longToken> who in the
            decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.
            Cursed, cursed be the fiend <pb xml:id="F1831_v_194" n="178"/>that brought misery on his
            grey hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors
            that were accumulated <longToken>around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way: he</longToken> was
            unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p17"/>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the
            only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in
            flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; <longToken>but I</longToken> awoke, and found
            myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of
            my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had called me
            mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my
            habitation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p18"/>Liberty, however, had been an useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason,
            at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me,
            I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon
            whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening
            rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within
            my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p19"/>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best
            means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired
            to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I
            knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority
            for the apprehension of the murderer.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p20"/>The magistrate listened to me with <longToken>attention and kindness:—“Be</longToken> assured, sir,” said he,
            “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p21"/>“I thank <longToken>you,” replied I; “listen, therefore,</longToken> to the deposition that I have to make. It
            is indeed a tale so strange, <longToken>that I should</longToken> fear you would not credit it, were there not
            something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too
            connected to be mis<pb xml:id="F1831_v_195" n="179"/>taken for a dream, and I have no
            motive for falsehood.” My manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I
            had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this
            purpose quieted <longToken>my agony, and for an interval</longToken> reconciled me to life. I now related my
            history, briefly, but with firmness and precision, <longToken>marking the</longToken> dates with accuracy, <longToken>and
            never deviating into invective or exclamation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p21"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p22"/>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became
            more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a
            lively surprise, unmingled with <longToken>disbelief, was painted on his countenance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p23"/></longToken>When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse, and for
            whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty
            as a magistrate, <longToken>and I believe and hope that</longToken> your feelings as a man will not revolt from
            the execution of those functions on this occasion.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p24"/>This address caused a considerable change in the <longToken>physiognomy of my own auditor.</longToken> He had
            heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and
            supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the
            whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly
            afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have
            powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can
            traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to
            intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no
            one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now
            inhabit.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p25"/>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed
            taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of
            prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to
            pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p26"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_196" n="180"/>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate
            was intimidated:—“You are mistaken,” said he, “I will exert myself; and if it is in my power
            to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his
            crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that
            this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you
            should make up your mind to disappointment.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p27"/>“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no
            moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring
            and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer,
            whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I have
            but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his
            destruction.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p28"/>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner,
            and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said
            to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other
            ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance
            of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale
            as the effects of delirium.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p29"/>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what
            it is you say.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p30"/>I broke from the house <longToken>angry and disturbed,</longToken> and retired to meditate on <longToken>some other mode
            of action.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div23_p30"/></longToken>
