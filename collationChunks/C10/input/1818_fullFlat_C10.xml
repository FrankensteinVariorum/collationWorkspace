   <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p1"/>I<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p1_hi1"/>T<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p1_hi1"/> was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the
            accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, <longToken>I collected the</longToken> instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
            lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered
            dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of
            the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it <longToken>breathed</longToken>
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_110" n="098"/>hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its
            limbs.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p2"/>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
            with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
            proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His
            yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a
            lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only
            formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same
            colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and
            straight black lips.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p3"/>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
            I had worked hard for <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_111" n="099"/>nearly two years, for the
            sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of
            rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now
            that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust
            filled my heart. <longToken>Unable to endure the aspect of the being</longToken> I had created, I rushed out of
            the room, and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind
            to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw
            myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
            But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought
            I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted
            and surprised, I em<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_112" n="100"/>braced her; but as I imprinted
            the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features
            appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a
            shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the
            flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth
            chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the
            moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch—the
            miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes,
            if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
            inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did
            not hear; one hand was <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_113" n="101"/>stretched out, seemingly to
            detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard
            belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night,
            walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and
            fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to
            which I had so miserably given life.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p4"/>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with
            animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished;
            he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it
            became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p5"/>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_114" n="102"/>hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery;
            at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled
            with this horror, I felt the <longToken>bitterness of disappointment:</longToken> dreams that had been <longToken>my food and pleasant</longToken> rest for so long a space, were now become a hell to me; and the change was
            so rapid, the overthrow so complete!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p6"/>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching
            eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth
            hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and
            I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
            wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not
            dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_115" n="103"/>impelled to hurry on, although wetted <longToken>by the rain,</longToken> which poured from a
            black and comfortless sky.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p7"/>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to
            ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear
            conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of
            fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about <longToken>me:<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p7"/> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p8"/></longToken>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p9"/>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at <longToken>which the various</longToken> diligences
            and carriages usually stopped. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_116" n="104"/>Here I paused, I knew not why; <longToken>but I</longToken> remained
            some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end
            of the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped
            just where I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval,
            who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad
            I am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my
            alighting!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p10"/>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my
            thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
            I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly,
            and for the first time during many months, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_117" n="105"/>calm
            and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we
            walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual
            friends, and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. <longToken>“You may easily</longToken> believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that <longToken>it was not absolutely necessary for a merchant not to understand any thing except book-keeping; and, indeed,</longToken> I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his
            constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch
            schoolmaster in the Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without
            Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame his
            dislike of learning, <longToken>and he has</longToken> permitted me to undertake <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_118" n="106"/>a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p11"/>“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father,
            brothers, and Elizabeth.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p12"/>“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By
            the bye, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.—But, my dear
            Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping short, and gazing full in my face, “I did not
            before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been
            watching for several nights.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p13"/>“You have guessed right; I have lately been <longToken>so deeply</longToken> engaged in one occupation, that I
            have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see: but I hope, I sincerely hope, that
            all these employments <longToken>are now</longToken> at an end, and that I am at length free.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p14"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_119" n="107"/>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to
            think of, and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked
            with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought
            made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might <longToken>still be there, alive,</longToken> and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that
            Henry should <longToken>see him. Entreating him therefore</longToken> to remain a few minutes at the bottom of
            the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already <longToken>on the lock of the door</longToken>
            before I recollected myself. I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw
            the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to
            stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_120" n="108"/>appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room
            was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a
            good-fortune could have befallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed
            fled, I clapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p15"/>We ascended into my room, and <longToken>the servant presently</longToken> brought breakfast; but I was unable
            to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with
            excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single
            instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed
            aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival; but when he
            observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_121" n="109"/>my eyes for which he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter,
            frightened and astonished him.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p16"/>“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that
            manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p17"/>“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw <longToken>the dreaded</longToken> spectre glide into the room; “<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p17_hi1"/>he<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p17_hi1"/> can tell.—Oh, save me!
            save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously, and fell down in
            a fit.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p18"/>Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with
            such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not <longToken>the witness of</longToken> his grief; for
            I was lifeless, and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p19"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_122" n="110"/>This was the commencement of a nervous fever,
            which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I
            afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age, and unfitness for so long a
            journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by
            concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and
            attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not
            doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards
            them.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p20"/>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting
            attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom
            I had bestowed existence was for ever before <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_123" n="111"/>my
            eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he at
            first believed <longToken>them to be</longToken> the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the
            pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my
            <longToken>disorder indeed</longToken> owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p21"/>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and grieved my friend, I
            recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with
            any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared, <longToken>and that the</longToken>
            young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine
            spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments
            of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_124" n="112"/>gloom
            disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the
            fatal passion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p22"/>“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole
            winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in
            my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the
            <longToken>disappointment of which</longToken> I have been the occasion; but you will forgive me.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p23"/>“You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as
            you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject,
            may I not?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p24"/>I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared
            not even think?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p25"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_125" n="113"/>“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my
            change of colour, “I will not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin
            would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own hand-writing. They
            hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at your long silence.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p26"/>“Is that all? my dear Henry. How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly
            towards those dear, dear friends whom I love, and who are so deserving of my love.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p27"/>“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will <longToken>perhaps be glad</longToken> to see a letter
            that has been lying here some days for you: it is from your cousin, I believe.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter4_div4_div4_p27"/>
