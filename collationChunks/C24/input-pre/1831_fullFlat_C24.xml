  Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. <longToken>I feared the
            vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the
            task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again
            devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of
            some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
            material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to
            visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and shrunk from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me: my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored;</longToken> and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my
            unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he
            turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
            which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast
            the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. <longToken>I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat,</longToken> watching the clouds, and listening
            to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun
            seldom failed to restore me to some degree <pb xml:id="F1831_v_148" n="132"/>of
            composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
            and a more cheerful heart.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p2"/>It was after my return from one of these rambles, that my father, calling me aside,
            thus addressed me:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p3"/>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and
            seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our
            society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
            an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such
            a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p4"/>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p5"/>“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear
            Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my declining years. You
            were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and
            appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is
            the experience of man, that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan, may
            have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish
            that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love;
            and, considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion
            the poignant misery which you appear to feel.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p6"/>“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never
            saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My
            future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p7"/>“The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more
            pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be
            happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which
            appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
            therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have
            been unfortunate, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_149" n="133"/>recent events have drawn us from
            that every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I
            do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage
            would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have
            formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a
            delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with
            candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p8"/>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering
            any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to
            arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth
            was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet
            fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend
            over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet
            hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and
            let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an
            union from which I expected peace.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p9"/>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England, or
            entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country, whose
            knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The
            latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory:
            besides, <longToken>I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father’s house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed. Once <pb xml:id="F1831_v_150" n="134"/>commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to</longToken> my family in peace and
            happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy
            imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery
            for ever.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p10"/>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England;
            but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under <longToken>a guise
            which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy, that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p10"/> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p11"/>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me, to remind me of my task, or to contemplate its progress?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p11"/> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p12"/>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth, and forget the past in my union with her.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p13"/>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one <pb xml:id="F1831_v_151" n="135"/>feeling haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I
            should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected
            from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to
            follow me wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to England? This
            imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of
            my friends. I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this
            might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature,
            I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations
            strongly intimated <longToken>that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger
            of his machinations.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p13"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p14"/><longToken>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth, therefore, acquiesced: but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances, which call forth a woman’s sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return,—a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute, as she bade me a tearful silent farewell.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p15"/>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I
            was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a
            bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be
            packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
            and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the
            bourne of my travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p16"/>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I
            arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was
            the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the
            beauties of the setting sun, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_152" n="136"/>and more happy when he
            beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of
            the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried,
            “now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and
            sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent of
            the evening star, nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine.—And you, my friend,
            would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
            eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch,
            haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p17"/>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we
            might take shipping for London. During this voyage, we passed many willowy islands, and
            saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our
            departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence
            becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and winds between hills, not
            high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the
            edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the
            Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged
            hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing
            beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with green
            sloping banks, and a meandering river, and populous towns occupy the scene.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p18"/>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the labourers, as we
            glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated
            by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed
            on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been
            a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as
            if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.
            “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful <pb xml:id="F1831_v_153" n="137"/>scenes of
            my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains
            descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades,
            which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the most verdant
            islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by
            a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an idea of what the
            water-spout must be on the great <longToken>ocean; and</longToken> the waves dash with fury the base of the
            mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where
            their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I
            have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this country, Victor,
            pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic
            and strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river, that I never before
            saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
            island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group
            of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of
            the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more
            in harmony with man, than those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible
            peaks of the mountains of our own country.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p18"/>
   <longToken><p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p19"/>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words, and to dwell on
            the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the
              <quote sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p19_quote1"/>“very poetry of nature.”<quote eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div18_p19_quote1"/> His wild and enthusiastic imagination was
            chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections,
            and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach
            us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
            satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with
            admiration, he loved with ardour:— <pb xml:id="F1831_v_154" n="138"/></longToken>
