   <head>PREFACE.</head>
   <p sID="preface1_p1"/>T<hi sID="preface1_p1_hi1"/>HE<hi eID="preface1_p1_hi1"/> event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by
        Dr. Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of impossible
        occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to
        such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not
        considered myself as merely <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_013" n="vi"/>weaving a series of
        supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from
        the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the
        novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact,
        affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more
        comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can
        yield.<p eID="preface1_p1"/>
   <p sID="preface1_p2"/>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_014" n="vii"/>principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their
        combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece,—Shakespeare, in the Tempest and
        Midsummer Night’s Dream,—and most especially Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule;
        and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours,
        may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the
        adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the
        highest specimens of poetry.<p eID="preface1_p2"/>
   <p sID="preface1_p3"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_015" n="viii"/>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested
        in casual conversation. It was commenced, partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an
        expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled with
        these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever
        moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader;
        yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects
        of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_016" n="ix"/>of
        the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions
        which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be
        conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn
        from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.<p eID="preface1_p3"/>
   <p sID="preface1_p4"/>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun in the
        majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_017" n="x"/>be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs
        of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing
        wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which
        happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation.
        Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the
        public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story,
        founded on some supernatural occurrence.<p eID="preface1_p4"/>
   <p sID="preface1_p5"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_018" n="xi"/>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two
        friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they
        present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has
        been completed.<p eID="preface1_p5"/>
