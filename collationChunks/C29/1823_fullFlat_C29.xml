   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p12"/>“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you
            are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a
            fortnight. <longToken>My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!</longToken> I expect to see you looking
            even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,
            tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your
            countenance, and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and
            tranquillity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p13"/>“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago,
            even perhaps augmented by <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_458" n="185"/>time. <longToken>I would not disturb
            you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon</longToken> you; but a conversation that I
            had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we
            meet.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p14"/>“Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really
            say this, my questions are answered, and I have no more to do than to sign myself your
            affectionate cousin. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread,
            and yet be pleased with this explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case,
            I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to
            express to you, but have never had the courage to begin.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p15"/>“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_459" n="186"/>your parents ever since our intimacy. We were told this
            when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
            place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and
            valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often
            entertain a lively affection towards each other, without desiring a more intimate union,
            may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you, by our
            mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p16"/>“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I
            confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to
            solitude, from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_460" n="187"/>might regret our connexion, and believe yourself bound
            in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your
            inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my cousin, that I love you,
            and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.
            But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own, when I declare to you, that our
            marriage would render me eternally miserable, unless it were the dictate of your own
            free choice. Even now I weep to think, that, borne down as you are by the cruelest
            misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p16_hi1"/>honour<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p16_hi1"/>, all hope of that
            love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have <longToken>so interested</longToken>
            an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold, by being an obstacle to your
            <longToken>wishes. Ah, Vic<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_461" n="188"/>tor,</longToken> be assured that your cousin and
            playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be
            happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing
            on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p17"/>“Do not let this letter disturb you; do <longToken>not answer it to-morrow, or the next day,</longToken> or
            even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your
            health; and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any
            other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p17"/>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p19"/>“Geneva, May 18th, 17—.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p20"/>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_462" n="189"/>of the fiend—“<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p20_hi1"/>I will be with you on
              your wedding-night!<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p20_hi1"/>” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dæmon
            employ every art to destroy me, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised
            partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his
            crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place,
            in which if he were victorious, I should be at peace, and his power over me be at an
            end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! what freedom? such as the
            peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt,
            his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, pennyless, and alone, but free.
            Such would be my liberty, except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure; alas! balanced
            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_463" n="190"/>by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which
            would pursue me until death.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p21"/>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter, and some softened feelings
            stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical dreams of love and joy; but the
            apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I
            would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;
            yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might
            indeed arrive a few months sooner; but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed
            it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other, and perhaps more dreadful
            means of revenge. He had vowed <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p21_hi1"/>to be with me on my wedding-night<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p21_hi1"/>,
            yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_464" n="191"/>the <longToken>meantime; for,</longToken> as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood,
            he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved,
            therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
            father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single
            hour.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p22"/>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I
            fear, my beloved girl,” I said, <longToken>“little happiness remains for us on earth; yet</longToken> all that
            I may one day enjoy is <longToken>centred in you.</longToken> Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
            consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
            dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far
            from being <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_465" n="192"/>surprised at my misery, <longToken>you will only
            wonder that I survive what I have endured.</longToken> I will confide this tale of misery and terror
            to you the day after our marriage shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be
            perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude
            to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p23"/>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Geneva. My
            cousin welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my
            emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner, and
            had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness,
            and soft looks of compassion, <longToken>made her a more fit companion for one blasted and
            miserable as I was.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p23"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p24"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_466" n="193"/>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.
            Memory brought madness with it; and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity
            possessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt with rage, sometimes low <longToken>and
              despondent. I neither spoke, nor looked at any one, but sat motionless,</longToken> bewildered by
            the multitude of miseries that overcame me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p25"/>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe
            me when transported by passion, and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
            She wept with me, and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour
            to inspire me with resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
            for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_467" n="194"/>otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of
            grief.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p26"/>Soon after my arrival, my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my cousin. I
            remained silent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p27"/>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p28"/>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with delight. Let the
            day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the
            happiness of my cousin.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p29"/>“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us; but let us only
            cling closer to what remains, and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those
            who yet live. Our circle will be small, but bound close by the ties of affection and
            mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_468" n="195"/>and dear objects of care will be born to replace those
            of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p30"/>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned:
            nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I
            should almost regard him as invincible; and that when he had pronounced the words, “<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p30_hi1"/><longToken>I shall be</longToken> with you on your wedding-night<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p30_hi1"/>,” I should regard the
            threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if the loss of Elizabeth
            were balanced with it; and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance,
            agreed with my <longToken>father, that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place
            in ten days,</longToken> and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p31"/>Great God! if for one instant I <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_469" n="196"/>had thought what
            might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished
            myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over the
            earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic
            powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I
            prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p32"/>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic
            feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of
            hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly
            deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union
            with placid contentment, not <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_470" n="197"/>unmingled with a little
            fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible
            happiness, might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep and
            everlasting regret.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p32"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p33"/>Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received; and all wore
            a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that
            preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although
            they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. <longToken>A house was purchased for us
            near Cologny, by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country, and yet be so near
            Geneva as to see my father every day; who would still reside within the walls, for the
            benefit of Ernest, that he might follow his studies at the schools.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p33"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p34"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_471" n="198"/>In the mean time I took every precaution to defend
            my person, in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
            constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these means
            <longToken>gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed,</longToken> as the period approached, the threat
            appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the
            happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day
            fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, <longToken>and I heard it continually spoken of</longToken> as an
            occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p34"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p35"/>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But
            on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_472" n="199"/>a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also
            she thought of the <longToken>dreadful secret,</longToken> which I had promised to reveal to her the following
            day. My father was in the mean time <longToken>overjoyed, and, in the bustle of</longToken> preparation, only
            recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p35"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p36"/>After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father’s; but it was
            agreed that Elizabeth and I should <longToken>pass the afternoon and night</longToken> at <longToken>Evian, and return to
              Cologny the next morning. As the day was fair,</longToken>  and the wind favourable, we resolved to
            go by water.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p36"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p37"/>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.
            We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind
            of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_473" n="200"/>sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of
            Montalêgre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the
            assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting
            the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that
            would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who
            should wish to enslave it.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p37"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p38"/>I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are <longToken>sorrowful, my love. Ah!</longToken> if you knew what I have
            suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and
            freedom from despair, that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p38"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p39"/>“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_474" n="201"/>nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a
            lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
            not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will not listen
            to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along, and how the clouds which
            sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of
            beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
            the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a
            divine day! how happy and serene all nature appears!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p39"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p40"/>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon
            melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her
            eyes, but it <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_475" n="202"/>continually gave place to distraction
            and reverie.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p40"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter21_div4_div22_p41"/>The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and observed its path
            through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come
            closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its
