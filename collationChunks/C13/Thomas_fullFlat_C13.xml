   </del>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2"/>“<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2_hi1"/>MY DEAR VICTOR<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2_hi1"/>,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p3"/>“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to
            us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on
            which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.
            What would be your surprise, my son, when <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_147" n="135"/>you
            expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
            And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous
            to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on an absent child? I wish to
            prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims
            over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p4"/>“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was
            so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the
            transaction.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p6"/>“Last Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in
            Plainpalais. The evening was <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_148" n="136"/>warm and serene, and
            we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
            returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were
            not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently
            Ernest came, and inquired if we had seen his brother: he said, that they had been
            playing together, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought
            for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p7"/>“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell,
            when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there.
            We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_149" n="137"/>boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the
            damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the
            morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active
            in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer’s
            finger was on his neck.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p8"/>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the
            secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to
            prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the
            neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my
            darling infant!’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9"/>“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was
            only to weep and sigh. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_150" n="138"/>She told me, that that same
            evening William had <del rend="strikethrough">teazed</del>
   <add place="above">entreated</add> her to let him wear a <del rend="strikethrough">very valuable</del> miniature that she
            possessed of your mother. <add place="margin">Which was set in jewels. </add>This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which
            urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our
            exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved
            William.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p10"/>“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and
            accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are
            all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be
            our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to
            witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p11"/>“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_151" n="139"/>of vengeance
            against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead
            of festering the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with
            kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p12"/>“Your affectionate and afflicted father,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p12"/>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
            the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
            friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
            “are you always to be <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_152" n="140"/>unhappy? My dear friend,
            what has happened?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the
            extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account
            of my misfortune.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.
            What do you intend to do?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits. He did not do this by common
            topics of consolation, <longToken>but by exhibiting the truest sympathy.</longToken> “Poor William!” said he,
            “that dear child; he now sleeps with his angel mother. His friends mourn and weep, but
            he is at rest: he does not <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_153" n="141"/>now feel the murderer’s
            grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit
            subject for pity; the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the
            only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind
            of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought
            not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p21"/>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on
            my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses
            arrived, I hurried into a cabriole, and bade farewell to my friend.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p22"/>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console
            and sympathize with <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_154" n="142"/>my loved and sorrowing
            friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly
            sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes
            familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every
            thing might be during that time? One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a
            thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which,
            although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame
            me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
            although I was unable to define them.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p23"/>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the
            lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm, and the snowy <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_155" n="143"/>mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not
            changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
            towards Geneva.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p24"/>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native
            town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of
            <longToken>Mont Blanc;</longToken> I wept like a child: “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you
            welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is
            this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p25"/>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary
            circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with
            pleasure. My <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_156" n="144"/>country, my beloved country! who but
            a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and,
            more than all, thy lovely lake.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p26"/>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around;
            and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture
            appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to
            become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in
            one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
            conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p27"/>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town
            were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_157" n="145"/>Secheron, a village half a league to the east of the city. The sky <add place="margin">above </add>was serene; <del rend="strikethrough">and,</del> as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William
            had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake
            in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings
            playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to
            approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
            progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly
            in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. <add>
      <del-INNER>but</del-INNER>
      <add-INNER place="overtop">And</add-INNER> the clouds were gathering on the <del-INNER>ris</del-INNER> horison, mass rising above mass, while the lightning they emitted shewed their shapes and size.</add>
   <p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p28"/>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
            minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
            Salêve, the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_158" n="146"/>Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid
            flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a
            vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until
            the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
            Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
            hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
            promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
            faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
            to the east of the lake.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p29"/>While I watched the storm, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.
            This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_159" n="147"/>and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is
            thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure
            which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I
            could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its
            shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous
            than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
            dæmon to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the
            conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination,
            than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean
            against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_160" n="148"/>it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have
            destroyed that fair child. <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p29_hi1"/>He<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p29_hi1"/> was the murderer! I could not doubt
            it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of
            pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to
            me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill
            that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p30"/>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene
            was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had
            until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress towards the creation; the
            appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my <longToken>bed side;</longToken> its depar<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_161" n="149"/>ture. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the
            night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned
            loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he
            not murdered my brother?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p31"/>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I
            spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
            weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
            whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
            horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
            my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
            me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p32"/>Day dawned; and I directed my steps <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_162" n="150"/>towards the
            town. The gates were open; and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to
            discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused
            when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and
            endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible
            mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the
            time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale
            otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a
            relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the
            strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as
            to persuade my relatives to commence it. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_163" n="151"/>
   <del rend="strikethrough">Besides</del>
   <add place="margin">And</add>,
            of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
            overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to
            remain silent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p32"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p33"/>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
            not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of
            rising.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p33"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p34"/>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in
            the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.
            Beloved and respectable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my
            mother, which stood over the mantlepiece. It was an historical subject, painted at my
            father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an ago<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_164" n="152"/>ny of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was
            rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly
            permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my
            tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had
            heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me:
            “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and
            then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. But we are now unhappy; and, I am
            afraid, tears instead of smiles will be your welcome. <del rend="strikethrough">Our father looks so sorrowful:
            this dreadful event seems to have revived in his mind his grief on the death of Mamma.
            Poor Elizabeth also is quite inconsolable.”</del>
   <add>the sense of our misfortune is yet unalleviated; the silence of our father is uninterrupted, and there is something more distressing than tears in his unaltered sadness—while poor Elizabeth, seeking solitude and for ever weeping, already begins to feel the effects of incessant grief—for her colour is gone, and her eyes are hollow &amp; lustreless</add> Er<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_165" n="153"/>nest
            began to weep as he said these words.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p34"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p35"/>“Do not,” said I, “welcome me thus; try to be more calm, that I may not be absolutely
      miserable the moment I enter my father’s house after so long an absence. <del rend="strikethrough">But, tell me, how does my father support his misfortunes? and how is</del>
   <add>You must assist me in acquiring sufficient calmness to console my father and support</add> my poor Elizabeth<del rend="strikethrough">?</del>”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p35"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p36"/>“She indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my
            brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been
            discovered—”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p36"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p37"/>“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him?
            It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a
            mountain-stream with a straw.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p37"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p38"/>“I do not know what you mean; but we were all very unhappy when <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_166" n="154"/>she was discovered. No one would believe it at
            first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.
            Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the
            family, could all at once become so extremely wicked?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p38"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p39"/>“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one
            knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p39"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p40"/>“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced
            conviction upon us: and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the
            evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried
            to-day, and you will then hear all.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p40"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p41"/>He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_167" n="155"/>been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and
            confined to her bed; and, after several days, one of the servants, happening to examine
            the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the
            picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The
            servant instantly shewed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of
            the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.
            On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure
            by her extreme confusion of manner.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p41"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p42"/>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You
            are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p42"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p43"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_168" n="156"/>At that instant my father entered. I saw
            unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me
            cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
            some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, Papa!
            Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p43"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p44"/>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for
            ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so
            highly.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p44"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p45"/>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p45"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p46"/>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and
            I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p46"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p47"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_169" n="157"/>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in
            my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
            had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong
            enough to convict her; and, in this assurance, I calmed myself, expecting the trial with
            eagerness, but without prognosticating an evil result.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p47"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p48"/>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had made great alterations in her form since I had last beheld her. Six years before she had been a pretty, good-humoured girl, whom
            every one loved and caressed. She was now a woman in stature and expression of
            countenance, which was uncommonly lovely. An open and capacious forehead gave
            indications of a good understanding, joined to great frankness of disposition. Her eyes
            were hazel, and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_170" n="158"/>expressive of mildness, now
            through recent affliction allied to sadness. Her hair was of a rich dark auburn, her
            complexion fair, and her figure slight and graceful. She welcomed me with the greatest
            affection. “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps
            will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be
            convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our
            misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this
            poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is
            condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and
            then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p48"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p49"/>“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_171" n="159"/>said I, “and
            that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of
            her acquittal.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p49"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p50"/>“How kind you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched; for
            I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a
            manner, rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p50"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p51"/>“Sweet niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent,
            rely on the justice of our judges, and the activity with which I shall prevent the
            slightest shadow of partiality.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p51"/>
