# chunk-23 notes
- when I was looking over this Readme, I noticed that some bulletpoints were missing. I may of forgotten to save this file. I am worried that I will miss some smaller, earlier misalignment that I previously wrote down. 
- put longToken around: 'Chap. 9' in msColl.
- `['hecon-temns ']` -> `['con-temns ']`
    - this is supposed to be 'he con-temns'. the rdgGrp has it pushed together.
    - put space after 'he' in manuscript. 
    - 'he' is moved from this rdgGrp to the one above it. 
- `['that', 'you']` ->
    - In 1823 and 1831, thw two words are mushed together. 
    - put space after 'that'
- `<rdgGrp n="['this', 'may', 'not']">` misalignment?
