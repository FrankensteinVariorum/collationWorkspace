				Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend. She was
				docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although she was
				lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her disposition
				uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit
				with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was
				luxuriant, yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of
				her mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive
				softness. Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great
				fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired &lt;pb

				her, as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person
				and mind united to so little pretension. &lt;p
