Her person was the image of her mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness. Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired &lt;pb xml:id=&quot;F1818_v1_059&quot; n=&quot;047&quot;/&gt;her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to so little pretension. &lt;p eID=&quot;novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9&quot;/&gt; </rdg>
