Our studies were never forced; and by some means we always had an end placed in view, which excited us to ardour in the prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not by emulation, that we were urged to application. Elizabeth was not incited to apply herself to drawing, that her companions might not outstrip her; but through the desire of pleasing her aunt, by the representation of some favourite scene done by her own hand. We learned Latin and English, that we might read the writings in those languages; and so far from study being made odious to us through punishment, we loved application, and our amusements would have been the labours of other children. Perhaps we did not read so many books, or learn languages so &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_062" n="050"/&gt;quickly, as those who are disciplined according to the ordinary methods; but what we learned was impressed the more deeply on our memories.&lt;/del&gt; &lt;note resp="#MWS"&gt;bad&lt;/note&gt; &lt;add place="bottom"&gt;With what delight do I even now remember the details of our domestic circle, and the happy years of my childhood.
