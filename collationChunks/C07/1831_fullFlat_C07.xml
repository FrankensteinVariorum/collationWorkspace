   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1"/> I <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1_hi1"/>AM<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1_hi1"/> by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most
            distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
            syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
            He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity and indefatigable attention to
            public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his
            country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until
            the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
            relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
            state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
            Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
            his rank and magni<pb xml:id="F1831_v_035" n="19"/>ficence. Having paid his debts,
            therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of
            Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the
            truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so
            little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek
            him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
            assistance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
            my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
            which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
            despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
            wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
            months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
            merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only
            became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took
            so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness,
            incapable of any exertion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
            their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
            support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
            rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
            various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely
            occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month
            her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame
            her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
            chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_036" n="20"/>poor
            girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend, he
            conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years
            after this event Caroline became his wife.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p6"/>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this
            circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a
            sense of justice in my father’s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should
            approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
            late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater value
            on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my
            mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by
            reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
            her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour
            to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to
            shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and
            to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
            benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,
            had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed
            previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public
            functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,
            and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
            as a restorative for her weakened frame.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p7"/>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,
            and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their
            only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible
            stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender
            caresses, and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my first
            recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—<pb xml:id="F1831_v_037" n="21"/>their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed
            on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands
            to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.
            With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given
            life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined
            that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of
            charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but one
            train of enjoyment to me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p8"/>For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,
            but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an
            excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of
            Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This,
            to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,—remembering what
            she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,—for her to act in her turn the
            guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of
            a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of
            half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day,
            when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this
            abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,
            distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which
            attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four
            others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very fair. Her
            hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to
            set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes
            cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and
            sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a
            being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_038" n="22"/>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed
            eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She
            was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German, and
            had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to
            nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child
            was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the
            memory of the antique glory of Italy,—one among the <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9_hi1"/>schiavi ognor
              frementi<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9_hi1"/>, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the
            victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of
            Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and a
            beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer
            than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p10"/>When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,
            a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her
            looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The
            apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic
            guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence
            had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and
            want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their
            village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my
            parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my
            occupations and my pleasures.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/>Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which
            all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening
            previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—“I have a
            pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she
            presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,
            interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect,
            love, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_039" n="23"/>cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I
            received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name
            of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she
            stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p11"/>

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/> W<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/>E<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/> were brought up together; there was not quite a year
            difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion
            or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast
            that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and
            more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
            application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied
            herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and
            wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains;
            the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and
            turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
            While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent
            appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a
            secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws
            of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest
            sensations I can remember.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely
            their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house
            in Geneva, and a <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/>campagne<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/> on Belrive, the eastern shore of the
            lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally
            in the latter, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_040" n="24"/>the lives of my parents were passed
            in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself
            fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I
            united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval
            was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved
            enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of
            chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of
            enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into
            masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the
            Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the
            holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were
            possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the
            tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all
            the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly
            discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement
            of filial love.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my
            temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to
            learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the
            structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,
            possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to
            learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature
            and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the
            metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.
            The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;
            and his hope and his dream was to become one among those <pb xml:id="F1831_v_041" n="25"/>whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our
            species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our
            peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her
            celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of
            love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the
            ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own
            gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet
            he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of
            kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded
            to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of
            his soaring ambition.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before
            misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness
            into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my
            early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale
            of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which
            afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and
            almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in
            its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in
            this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When
            I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near
            Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In
            this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
            with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which
            he relates, soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon
            my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_042" n="26"/>My father looked carelessly at the titlepage of my book,
            and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it
            is sad trash.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the
            principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science
            had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the
            powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical;
            under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and have
            contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my
            former studies. It is even possible, that the train of my ideas would never have
            received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had
            taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and
            I continued to read with the greatest avidity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
            afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of
            these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself. I
            have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate
            the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of
            modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir
            Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside
            the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of
            natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions,
            as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their
            practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled
            the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He
            might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in
            their secondary and tertiary grades were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_043" n="27"/>utterly
            unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
            human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had
            repined.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took
            their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange
            that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of
            education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to
            my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a
            child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my
            new preceptors, I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the
            philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided
            attention. Wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the discovery, if
            I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a
            violent death!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p12"/>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally
            accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if
            my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own
            inexperience and mistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And
            thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a
            thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately in a very slough of
            multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an
            accident again changed the current of my ideas.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p13"/>When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we
            witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the
            mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various
            quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with
            curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire
            issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our <pb xml:id="F1831_v_044" n="28"/>house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the
            oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the
            next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by
            the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribands of wood. I never beheld anything so
            utterly destroyed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this
            occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this
            catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the
            subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All
            that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and
            Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men
            disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or
            could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
            By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early
            youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its
            progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a
            would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In
            this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study
            appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of
            my consideration.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to
            prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change
            of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—            the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then
            hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual
            tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and
            latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
            their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_045" n="29"/>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it
            was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
            terrible destruction.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/>
