- [x]  Very long longToken around first paragraph and a half of 1831. Collation
properly aligns this with the second full paragraph of the other editions (correctly
because they are all about Victor's father.) 
- [x] Edit in Thomas compels `<longToken>` in all editions around "to prove to me the futility of pride."
- [x] longToken around "my tongue" in all editions, + longer passage added in 1831 (up to and including "and was silent")
- [x] Removed extra `<p/>` end and start tags around editorial comment in f1818 and fThomas. 
- [x] THESE SHOULD BE CORRECTED IN THE SOURCE FILES! (Done!)
- [x] Extend longTokens in "the world to have confided the fatal secret" passage to prevent two-witness app.
- [x] Unite apps with longToken in "What do you mean, Victor? Are you mad?"  
- [x] Transpoition problem: "desired sometimes" vs. "sometimes desired"
- [x] MS has a long passage ending in "vivacity" not in the other witnesses after "The Sea of Ice": connect in a longToken 
- [x] Merge two apps: wrapping longToken around `that had taken place` in print editions.
