   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p1"/><longToken>T<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p1_hi1"/>HE<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p1_hi1"/> voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength, and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable; but he did not know the origin of my sufferings, and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them, whose joy it was to shed their blood, and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me, and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts, and the crimes which had their source in me!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p1"/> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p2"/>My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society, and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.</longToken> Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation
            of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured <longToken>to prove to me the futility of pride.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p3"/>“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and
            passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor
            unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for
            it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died
            by my hands.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p4"/>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I
            thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he
            appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some
            idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I
            preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_182" n="166"/>and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a
            persuasion that I should be supposed mad; and this in itself would for ever have chained
            <longToken>my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation, and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy, and was silent</longToken> when I
            would have given <longToken>the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet still words like those I have recorded, would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them; but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p5"/>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “My dearest
            Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an
            assertion again.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p6"/>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
            operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
            victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
            drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
            sacrifice the whole human race.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p7"/>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he
            instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and endeavoured to alter the course
            of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes
            that had taken place in Ireland, and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of
            my misfortunes.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p8"/>As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no
            longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the
            consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of
            wretchedness, which <longToken>sometimes desired</longToken> to declare itself to the whole world; and my
            manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to <longToken>the sea of ice.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p9"/>A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following
            letter from Elizabeth:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter22_div4_div22_p9"/>
