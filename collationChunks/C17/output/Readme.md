# Collation Chunk 17 Notes:
Lines/parts to look at:
- "descended; but presently I"
- "I sought a place where I could perceive"
- "by the side of a brook"
- "ate some berries which I found hanging" /// Unnecessary spaces in collation? 
- "I felt cold also and half frightened" /// Unnecessary spaces in collation? 

Changes:
- [x] "opaque bodies had surrounded me,"  /// Removed space to combine "me" and "," in manuscript 
- [x] "This roused me from my nearly dormant state"  /// Added space to split "nearly" and "dormant" in manuscript 
- [x] "more & more opressive to me and the heat wearying"  /// Added space to split "%/and" and "more" in manuscript
