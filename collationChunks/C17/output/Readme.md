# Collation Chunk 17 Notes (March 2, 2023):
Changes:
- "exquisite and divine" // put together so 'anddivine" turns into 'and', 'divine' in MS
- longToken around "It was morning when I"?
- "greedily devoured the remnants" // put together ['rem', '', 'n', '', 'ants'] to turn into ['remnants']
- 
Notes: 
- "branches and then spreading my cloak I"
- "attempts to supply it, and wrapping" \\ "wrapping" to be put together?
- "substance that covered the" ground"
- "convenience of some shepard" shepard vs shepeard
- Thomas Ver. seems to have changes later on in this chunk.
