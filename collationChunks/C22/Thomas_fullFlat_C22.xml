   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p1"/> “C<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p1_hi1"/>URSED<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p1_hi1"/>, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that
            instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?
            I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage
            and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants, and
            have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p2"/>“When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer
            restrained by the <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_125" n="121"/>fear of discovery, I gave vent
            to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils;
            destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging through the wood with a stag-like
            swiftness. Oh! what a miserable night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and the
            bare trees waved their branches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst
            forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: I, like
            the <longToken>arch fiend</longToken>, bore a hell within me; and, finding myself unsympathized with, wished to
            tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and
            enjoyed the ruin.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p3"/>“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with
            excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in the <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_126" n="122"/>sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that
            existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No:
            from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and, more than all,
            against him who had formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p4"/>“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was impossible to return to
            my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood,
            determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p5"/>“The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some degree of
            tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help
            believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_127" n="123"/>I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation
            had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to
            the horror of his children. I ought <longToken>to have familiarized</longToken> the old De Lacey to me, and by
            degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been
            prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable; and,
            after much consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by
            my representations win him to my party.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p6"/>“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the
            fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene
            of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_128" n="124"/>and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father’s
            feet. I awoke exhausted; and, finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my
            hiding-place, and went in search of food.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p7"/>“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that
            conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my hovel, and remained in
            silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour past, the sun
            mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently,
            apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard
            no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspence.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p8"/>“Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they entered into
            conversation, using violent <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_129" n="125"/>gesticulations; but I
            did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which
            differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another
            man: I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and
            waited anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the meaning of these unusual
            appearances.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p9"/>“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, ‘that you will be obliged to pay three
            months’ rent, and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair
            advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
            determination.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p10"/>“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix, ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage. The
            life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_130" n="126"/>dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will
            never recover their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take
            possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p11"/>“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in
            which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family
            of De Lacey more.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p12"/>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid
            despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link that held me to the
            world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did
            not strive to controul them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent
            my mind towards injury and <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_131" n="127"/>death. When I thought
            of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
            exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat
            soothed me. But again, when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger
            returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any thing human, I turned my fury
            towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around
            the cottage; and, after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in <longToken>the garden,</longToken> I
            waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p13"/>“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly dispersed the
            clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along like a mighty avelanche,
            and produced <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_132" n="128"/>a kind of insanity in my spirits,
            that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree, and
            danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon,
            the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I
            waved my brand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I fired the straw, and heath, and
            bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly
            enveloped by the flames, which clung to it, and licked it with their forked and
            destroying tongues.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p14"/>“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I
            quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p15"/>“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly
            far from the scene of my <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_133" n="129"/>misfortunes; but to me,
            hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you
            crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to
            whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the
            lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie geography had not been omitted: I had learned
            from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had
            mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place I resolved to
            proceed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p16"/>“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a south-westerly
            direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the
            names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single
            human <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_134" n="130"/>being; but I did not despair. From you only
            could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.
            Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then
            cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any
            claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I
            vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p17"/>“My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn when
            I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful
            of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun
            became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_135" n="131"/>frozen; the surface of the earth was hard, and
            chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on
            the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned
            to gall <longToken>and bitterness.</longToken> The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did
            I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were
            hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a
            map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings
            allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not
            extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of
            Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look 
            <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_136" n="132"/>green, confirmed in an especial manner the
            bitterness and horror of my feelings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p18"/>“I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was secured by night from
            the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I
            ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the
            first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
            the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive
            within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be
            borne away by them; and, forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft
            tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards
            the <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_137" n="133"/>blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon
            me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p19"/>“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which
            was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches,
            now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to
            pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the
            shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot
            where I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her
            course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she
            fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my <longToken>hiding place, and,</longToken> with extreme labour from
            the force of the current, saved her, and dragged her <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_138" n="134"/>to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my
            power, to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a
            rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he
            darted towards me, and, tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts
            of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near,
            he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my
            injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p20"/><longToken>“This was then</longToken> the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from
            destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound,
            which shattered the flesh and bone. The <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_139" n="135"/>feelings
            of kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few moments before, gave place
            to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and
            vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I
            fainted.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p21"/>“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound
            which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had
            remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My
            sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude
            of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as
            would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p22"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_140" n="136"/>“After some weeks my wound healed, and I
            continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the
            bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my
            desolate state, and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of
            pleasure.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p23"/>“But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I reached the
            environs of Geneva.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p24"/>“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that
            surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by
            fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or the
            prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p25"/>“At this time a slight sleep relieved <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_141" n="137"/>me from the
            pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
            running into the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as
            I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced, and had
            lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could
            seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
            this peopled earth.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p26"/>“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him towards me. As
            soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes, and uttered a shrill
            scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face, and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of
            this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p27"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_142" n="138"/>“He struggled <longToken>violently; ‘Let</longToken> me go,’ he cried;
            ‘monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat me, and tear me to pieces—You are an ogre—Let me
            go, or I will tell my papa.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p28"/>“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p29"/>“‘Hideous monster! let me go; My papa is a Syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he would punish
            you. You dare not keep me.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p30"/>“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal
            revenge; you shall be my first victim.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p31"/>“The child still struggled, and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my
            heart: I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p32"/>“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hell<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_143" n="139"/>ish triumph: clapping my <longToken>hands, I exclaimed,</longToken> ‘I,
            too, can create desolation; my enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry despair
            to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p32"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p33"/>“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. <longToken>I took it;</longToken>
            it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and
            attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep
            lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for
            ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she
            whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine
            benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p33"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p34"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_144" n="140"/>“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me
            with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
            exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to
            destroy them.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p34"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p35"/>“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the
            murder, and <longToken>was seeking</longToken> a more secluded hiding-place, <longToken>when I perceived</longToken> a woman passing
            near me. She was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an
            agreeable aspect, and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought,
            is one of those whose smiles are bestowed on all but me; she shall not escape: thanks to
            the lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man, I <longToken>have learned how</longToken> to work
            mischief. I approached her unperceived, and placed <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_145" n="141"/>the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p35"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p36"/>“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place; sometimes wishing
            to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. At length I
            wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses,
            consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you
            have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone, and miserable; man will not
            associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to
            me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects. This being you
            must create.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter15_div4_div16_p36"/>
