   <longToken><head>CHAPTER XII</head> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p1"/>M<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p1_hi1"/>Y<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p1_hi1"/> present situation was</longToken> one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.
            I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it
            moulded my feelings, and allowed me to be calculating and calm, at periods when
            otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p2"/>My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy
            and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself
            with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_496" n="223"/>a sum of money, together with a few jewels which
            had belonged to my mother, and departed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p3"/>And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast
            portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers, in deserts
            and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times
            have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But
            revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p4"/>When I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the
            steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled; and I wandered many hours round
            the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_497" n="224"/>approached, I found myself at the entrance of the
            cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father, reposed. I entered it, and approached
            the tomb which marked their graves. Every thing was silent, except the leaves of the
            trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; <longToken>and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The</longToken> spirits of
            the departed seemed to flit around, and to cast a <longToken>shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p5"/>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and
            despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I
            must drag out my weary existence. <longToken>I knelt on the grass, and kissed the earth,</longToken> and with
              quiver<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_498" n="225"/>ing lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on
            which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I
            feel, I <longToken>swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon,</longToken> who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For
            this purpose I will preserve my life: to execute this dear revenge, will I again behold
            the sun, and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
            eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and on you, wandering ministers
            of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink
            deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p6"/>I had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_499" n="226"/>assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard
            and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and <longToken>rage choaked my utterance.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p7"/>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rung on
            my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell
            surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been
            possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was
            heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away; when a well-known
            and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—“I am
            satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p8"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_500" n="227"/>I darted towards the spot from which the sound
            proceeded; but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and
            shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal
            speed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p9"/>I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I
            followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. <longToken>The blue Mediterranean</longToken> appeared; and, by
            a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for
            the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p10"/>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever
            followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition,
            informed me of his <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_501" n="228"/>path; sometimes he <longToken>himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him, I</longToken> should <longToken>despair and die,</longToken> left some mark to
            guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the
            white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how
            can you understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the
            least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried
            about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my
            <longToken>steps, and,</longToken> when I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly
            insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the
            exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited <longToken>me. The fare was indeed <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_502" n="229"/>coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate;</longToken> but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
            invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by
            thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and
            vanish.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p11"/>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided
            these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other
            places human beings were seldom seen; and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that
            crossed my path. I had money with me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by
            distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a
            small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for
            cooking.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p12"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_503" n="230"/>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to
            me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when
            most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits
            that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that I might
            retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk
            under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night:
            for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the
            benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and
            beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I
            persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come, and that I should then
            enjoy reality in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_504" n="231"/>the arms of my dearest friends. What
            agonizing fondness did I feel for them! how did I cling to their dear forms, as
            sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!
            At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my
            path towards the destruction of the dæmon, more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
            mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire
            of my soul.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p13"/>What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks
            in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that guided me, and instigated my
            fury. “My reign is not yet over,” (these words were legible in one of these
            <longToken>inscriptions); “you live, and my</longToken> power is complete. Follow me; I seek the ever<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_505" n="232"/>lasting ices of the north, where you will feel the
            misery of cold and <longToken>frost, to which I am impassive.</longToken> You will find near this place, if you
            follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat, and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have
            yet to wrestle for our lives; but many hard and miserable hours <longToken>must you endure, until that period shall arrive.”</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p14"/>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to
            torture and <longToken>death. Never will I give up my search, until he or I perish;</longToken> and then with
            what <longToken>ecstacy shall I join my Elizabeth, and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage.</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p15"/>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, <longToken>the snows thickened, and the cold</longToken>
            increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_506" n="233"/>were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the
            most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their
            hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
            procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p16"/>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription
            that he left was in these words: “Prepare! your toils only begin: wrap yourself in furs,
            and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will
            satisfy my everlasting hatred.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p17"/>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to
            fail in my purpose; and, calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated
            fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean ap<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_507" n="234"/>peared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how unlike it
            was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished
            from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they
            beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of
            their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full heart, thanked my
            guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding
            my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p18"/>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and thus traversed the
            snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same
            advantages; but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now
            gained on <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_508" n="235"/>him; so much so, that when I first saw the
            ocean, he was but one day’s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he
            should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days
            arrived at a wretched hamlet on the sea-shore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning
            the fiend, and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived
            the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols; putting to flight the inhabitants
            of a solitary cottage, through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their
            store of winter food, and, placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
            numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of
            the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_509" n="236"/>that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must
            speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen by the eternal frosts.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p19"/>On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped
            me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous
            ices of the ocean, —amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure, and which
            I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea
            that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and, like
            a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the
            spirits of the dead hovered round, and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for
            my journey.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p20"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_510" n="237"/>I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the
            inequalities of the frozen ocean; and, purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
            departed from land.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p21"/>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured misery, which
            nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could
            have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my
            passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my
            destruction. But again the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p22"/>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed
            three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon
            the heart, often <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_511" n="238"/>wrung bitter drops of despondency
            and grief from my <longToken>eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.</longToken> Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me <longToken>had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice-mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish,</longToken> when suddenly my eye caught
            a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be, and
            uttered a wild cry of ecstacy When I distinguished a sledge, and the distorted
            proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! with what a burning gush did hope revisit my
            heart! warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not
            intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_512" n="239"/>burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
            oppressed me, I wept aloud.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p23"/>But this was not the time for delay: I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion,
            gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely
            necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge
            was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a
            short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly
            gained on it; and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more
            than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p24"/>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes were suddenly
            extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_513" n="240"/>ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder
            of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more
            ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as
            with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a tremendous and
            overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled
            between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was
            continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p25"/>In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and I myself was
            about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I saw your vessel riding at
            anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I had no conception that
            vessels <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_514" n="241"/>ever came so far north, and was astounded at
            the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars; and by these means
            was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of your ship. I
            had determined, if you were going southward, still to trust myself to the mercy of the
            seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which
            I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northward. You took me on board when my
            vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a
            death which I still dread—for my task is unfulfilled.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p26"/>Oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow me the rest I so
            much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall
            not escape; <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_515" n="242"/>that you will seek him, and satisfy my
            vengeance in his death. And <longToken>do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage,</longToken> to
            endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am
            dead, if he should appear; if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you,
            swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes,
            and survive to make another such wretch as I am. He is eloquent and persuasive; and once
            his words had even power over my heart: but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his
            form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the manes of
            William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust
            your sword into his heart. I will hover near, and direct the steel aright.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter23_div4_div24_p26"/>
