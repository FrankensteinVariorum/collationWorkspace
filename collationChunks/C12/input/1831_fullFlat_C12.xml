            instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion
            greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In
            another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.<pb xml:id="F1831_v_069" n="53"/>
   <p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several
            professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill
            befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of
            my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy
            even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health,
            the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
            Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my
            apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
            previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I
            visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and
            warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I
            disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
            modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a
            desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and
            he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those
            instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I
            writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and
            feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject,
            alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.
            I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was
            surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him
            with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never
            persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my
            recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more
            deeply.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost
            insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the
              bene<pb xml:id="F1831_v_070" n="54"/>volent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n the
            fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript <longToken>us all. Ay,</longToken> stare if
            you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed
            <longToken>in Cornelius</longToken> Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the
            university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out <longToken>of countenance.—Ay, ay,”</longToken> continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is
            modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of
            themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very
            short time.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation
            from a subject that was so annoying to me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his <longToken>literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, as thus he</longToken>
            should open a field <longToken>for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.</longToken> <longToken>The Persian, Arabic, and Sanscrit languages</longToken> engaged his attention, 
  <longToken>and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.</longToken> Idleness had ever been
            irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former
            studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
            only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him,
            attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any
            other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning,
            and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating,
            to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you
            read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and <longToken>a garden</longToken> of roses,—in the
            smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How
            different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!<pb xml:id="F1831_v_071" n="55"/>
   <p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the
            latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived,
            the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.
            I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved
            friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval
            in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The
            winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when
            it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>The month of May had already commenced, and <longToken>I expected the letter daily</longToken> which was to
            fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of
            Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.
            I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had
            always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among
            the scenes of my native country.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p21"/>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been
            restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the
            natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before
            secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
            Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the
            aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely
            did you love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own!
            A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection
            warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago,
            loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the
            power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields
            filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
            bloomed in the hedges, while those<pb xml:id="F1831_v_072" n="56"/> of summer were
            already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had
            pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible
            burden.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p22"/>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted
            himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The
            resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full
            of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he
            invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite
            poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p23"/>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every
            one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with
            feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
