                    <p>Insurance coverage can be confusing, but it doesn’t have to be. To help you
                        make informed decisions about your insurance coverage, take a look at some
                        of the common insurance terms and definitions. Still have questions? Review

                    <h2> Acceleration clause</h2>
                    <p>A clause used in your insurance contract that gives your insurer the right to
                        demand payment for your policy in full, under specific circumstances
                        outlined there. What could cause your insurer to invoke the acceleration
                        clause? A couple of examples would be non-payment of premiums by a certain
                        date or destruction of property.</p>
                    <h2>Accident forgiveness</h2>

                        refers to your insurance rates not raising after your first at-fault car
                        accident.</p>
                    <h2>Accident report form&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p>If you’re involved in an auto accident, the police officer on the scene
                        produces this document, which is also known as the police report. This
                        report has important details about the accident that will be useful to the
                        insurance claims adjuster and it assists with processing and evaluating your
                        claim.</p>
                    <p>Here are just a few details you’ll find in the report: Location of the
                        accident, people who were involved in the accident, their account of what
                        caused the accident, outcomes of the accident such as damage to vehicles and
                        other property, weather conditions, extent of injuries (if any) and whether
                        citations were issued.</p>
                    <h2>Actual cash value (ACV)</h2>
                    <p>Actual cash value is the amount you’ll be reimbursed for what the items or
                        damage cost to repair or replace, minus the depreciation. Actual cash value
                        is likely to be different than the replacement cost value. </p>
                    <h2>Agent</h2>
                    <p>An <a href="/find-an-insurance-agent" tabindex="0">insurance
                        agent</a>&nbsp;at ERIE is a licensed and trusted insurance advisor, ready to
                        help answer any questions you have about your insurance. Agents are often
                        certified with insurance designations showing they have completed education
                        and training to help customers during the insurance buying process. Erie
                        Insurance agents are independent agents. </p>
                    <h2>Appraisal</h2>
                    <p>An appraisal is the assessment of the value of your property or the extent of
                        property damage that has been documented by a qualified professional.
                        Appraisals are performed to determine the value of property after a covered
                        loss.</p>
                    <h2>At fault</h2>
                    <p>When someone’s involved in an accident, the insurance company has to figure
                        out who caused it and how other drivers (if there were any) played a role.
                        In the end, the insurance companies assign a percentage of fault to each
                        driver. The insurance companies investigating the claims use these
                        percentages to determine how much each insurance company pays to cover the
                        costs of the damages.</p>
                    <h2>Binder</h2>
                    <p>A binder is a temporary insurance contract that provides proof of coverage
                        until a permanent policy is issued. For example, when you purchase a new
                        vehicle and you need to call your ERIE Agent to bind coverage until you get
                        the official paperwork complete.</p>
                    <h2>Bodily injury liability (coverage)</h2>
                    <p>If you are responsible for a car accident that causes bodily injury to
                        others, <a href="/insurance-dictionary/liability-coverage" tabindex="0"
                            >bodily injury liability</a>&nbsp;coverage helps pay for the medical
                        expenses of the people (not including you) harmed in the accident. Most
                        states have laws that require you to have bodily injury liability coverage
                        on your car insurance policy. </p>
                    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
                    <p>Cancellation is the termination of insurance at any time other than the
                        renewal date. Typically, you will be given notice explaining the reason why
                        your policy is being cancelled. </p>
                    <h2>Claim</h2>
                    <p>If you're involved in a car accident, or something else happens that damages
                        your car, one of the first things you'll do is report it to your insurance
                        company — that's filing a claim. This begins the process so you can get
                        reimbursed for your loss.</p>
                    <h2>Claims adjuster</h2>
                    <p>Once you file a claim, the insurance company representative you’ll be working
                        with is the claims adjuster. You can expect the claims adjuster to contact
                        you, explain the process and then begin his or her investigation of the
                        claim. It’s helpful to keep your information about your policy and claim in
                        one place and within reach throughout the claims process. </p>
                    <p>When the investigation is completed, the claims adjuster will make a
                        settlement, which is the amount the insurance company will pay for the loss.
                        Their goal is to help you understand the process, and make sure you and any
                        other individuals involved are fairly compensated. </p>
                    <h2>Coinsurance</h2>
                    <p>Coinsurance, in property insurance terms, requires the policyholder to carry
                        insurance equal to a specified percentage of the value of property to
                        receive full payment on a loss. For health insurance, it’s a percentage of
                        each claim above the deductible paid by the policyholder.</p>
                    <h2>Collision coverage</h2>
                    <p><a href="/insurance-dictionary/collision-insurance" tabindex="0">Collision
                            coverage</a> helps you cover the costs of repairing or replacing your
                        vehicle after it is damaged in a collision. Most drivers end up paying a
                        deductible, so check your policy or ask your agent to find out what your
                        up-front expense would be. Collision insurance is often required by lenders,
                        but once you own the vehicle, it may be optional. Talk to your agent to find
                        out if collision coverage makes sense for you. </p>
                    <h2>Comprehensive coverage</h2>
                    <p><a href="/insurance-dictionary/comprehensive-insurance" tabindex="0"
                            >Comprehensive coverage</a> helps you pay for damages caused by theft,
                        fire, vandalism, a falling tree and other things that are covered in your
                        policy. Your auto lender may require you to carry comprehensive on your
                        automobile policy. But once you own the vehicle outright, this coverage is
                        optional. </p>
                    <h2>Coverage</h2>
                    <p>Coverage is the protection and benefits provided in an insurance contract.
                        Insurance coverage helps consumers recover financially from unexpected
                        events. A trusted insurance agent can help you select the best coverage to
                        suit your needs. </p>
                    <h2>Convertible</h2>
                    <p>Term life insurance coverage that can be converted into permanent insurance,
                        regardless of an insured’s physical condition and without a medical
                        examination.</p>
                    <h2>Covered loss</h2>
                    <p>The types of accidents, damages and situations that are covered by your
                        insurance policy. If you have any specific concerns or questions about what
                        is covered and what isn’t, be sure and talk to your agent so you understand
                        how your automobile policy works for you.</p>
                    <h2>Damage</h2>
                    <p>Damage refers to the physical harm to or loss of a person or property.</p>
                    <h2>Damages</h2>
                    <p>Damages is the money one party is legally obligated to pay to another
                        party.</p>
                    <h2>Declarations page</h2>
                    <p>Your insurance declarations page, also known as the dec page, is customized
                        to you and summarizes the information essential to your insurance coverage.
                        It includes your name and address, effective policy dates, insured property,
                        policy coverages, limits, deductibles, discounts, policy forms and
                        endorsements.You’ll also find your Erie Insurance agent’s contact
                        information on the declarations page.</p>
                    <h2>Deductible</h2>
                    <p>The <a href="/insurance-dictionary/deductible" tabindex="0"
                        >deductible</a>&nbsp;is how much money you’ll be paying out of pocket before
                        insurance kicks in. Let’s say you crash your car into a tree, causing $1,200
                        in damages to your car. Your policy has a $500 deductible. That means you
                        would pay the first $500 toward the repair bill and the insurance company
                        would pay for the remaining $700. Many people opt for higher deductible
                        plans in exchange for lower premiums.</p>
                    <h2>Discount</h2>
                    <p>An <a href="/auto-insurance/insurance-discounts" tabindex="0">insurance
                            discount</a>&nbsp;is a reduction in insurance premium determined by
                        several factors. As an ERIE customer, you may be eligible for one or more of
                        the discounts we offer. Discounts vary by state.</p>
                    <h2>Effective Date</h2>
                    <p>The date your policy’s coverage goes into effect.</p>
                    <h2>Emergency road service</h2>
                    <p><a href="/auto-insurance/emergency-road-service" tabindex="0">Emergency road
                            service</a> is available from ERIE as an additional coverage at a low
                        cost. Emergency roadside service is for unexpected events on your insured
                        vehicle that leave the vehicle disabled. (And just in case you need
                        it—here’s the number to reach ERIE’s Roadside Service—800-FOR-ERIE
                        (800-367-3743).</p>
                    <h2>Endorsement</h2>
                    <p>An endorsement is when a change is made to an existing insurance policy. What
                        often triggers an endorsement are life changes, which include: marriage,
                        moving, buying a new vehicle, adding a driver to your family or removing a
                        driver. When events like these happen, it’s always a good time to review
                        your insurance policies and make sure you have all the coverage you and your
                        family need. Endorsements could also mean a coverage part. For instance, if
                        you purchase Roadside and Rental, the Roadside and Rental coverage will be
                        attached to your policy.</p>
                    <h2>Exclusions</h2>
                    <p>Exclusions are specific situations that your insurance company will not
                        cover. It’s important to understand the exclusions included in the policy.
                        For example, if you work for a rideshare company, you will want to talk to
                        your agent about whether you need additional insurance to cover your needs. </p>
                    <h2>Floater</h2>
                    <p>A floater is a separate policy available to cover the value of goods beyond
                        the coverage of a standard renters insurance policy, including movable
                        property such as jewelry or sports equipment.</p>
                    <h2>Gap insurance</h2>
                    <p>If you’re paying on a car loan or a lease, your car may be valued for less
                        than what you owe. So, if your car is totaled in an accident, <a
                            href="/insurance-dictionary/gap-insurance" tabindex="0">gap
                            insurance</a>&nbsp;helps you pay off your loan or lease, minus the
                        deductible.</p>
                    <h2>Hazard</h2>
                    <p>A hazard is any circumstance that causes or increases the likelihood of a
                        peril or loss. </p>
                    <h2>Independent agent, independent agency</h2>
                    <p>Many insurance agents work directly for one specific insurance company. Some,
                        however, are independent agents. Independent agents may represent multiple
                        insurance companies. Their goal is to help you find the best policy that
                        meets your insurance needs. </p>
                    <h2>Insurance</h2>
                    <p>Insurance helps protect you from losing money when faced with an unexpected
                        event. By purchasing insurance, the company where insurance is purchased
                        from takes on the risk that is stated in the insurance policy.</p>
                    <h2>Insurance identification card</h2>
                    <p>An <a href="/support-center/id-card" tabindex="0">insurance identification
                            (ID) card</a>&nbsp;contains basic information about your insurance
                        policy. Insurance ID cards may be used to provide proof of insurance. </p>
                    <h2>Insurance adjuster</h2>
                    <p>Insurance adjusters will evaluate your claim and determine if the claim is
                        covered and the amount the insurance company should pay you. </p>
                    <h2>Insurance score</h2>
                    <p><a href="/support-center/insurance-scoring" tabindex="0">Insurance
                        score</a>&nbsp;is one variable used to help calculate your rate for
                        insurance coverage. It’s different than a credit score and the method for
                        calculating it varies from insurer to insurer.</p>
                    <h2>Insured</h2>
                    <p>The insured is the person (or people) covered in an insurance policy in the
                        event of a loss or claim. </p>
                    <h2>Insurer</h2>
                    <p>The insurer is the company providing you with financial coverage in the case
                        of unexpected events covered on your insurance policy. If you have a policy
                        through ERIE, ERIE would be your <em>insurer</em>.</p>
                    <h2>Lapse</h2>
                    <p>A lapse in coverage is when you don’t have insurance for a period of time. No
                        matter the cause of the lapse, your rates may go up if an insurance company
                        sees there was a time you had no insurance. It’s important you protect
                        yourself by having insurance at all times.</p>
                    <h2>Liability coverage</h2>
                    <p>Let’s say you caused an accident and were found at fault. Perhaps you
                        rear-ended a car stopped at a traffic light, or perhaps you lost control of
                        your car on an icy road. Your liability will cover the costs of the damage
                        you caused the other vehicles and property, as well as injuries to other
                        people involved in the accident. In most states, <a
                            href="/insurance-dictionary/liability-coverage" tabindex="0">liability
                            coverage</a>&nbsp;is mandatory. Property damage liability won’t cover
                        damage to your own vehicle. That’s where collision coverage comes in. </p>
                    <h2>Limit</h2>
                    <p>An insurance limit is the maximum dollar amount an insurance company will pay
                        for a covered claim. </p>
                    <h2>Loss</h2>
                    <p>The costs or expenses incurred due to a claim.</p>
                    <h2>Medical payments coverage</h2>
                    <p>If you are hurt in a car accident, this coverage pays for your medical
                        expenses, even if you were found at fault. It also covers injuries suffered
                        by other passengers, as well as any funeral expenses. </p>
                    <h2>Motor vehicle report (MVR)</h2>
                    <p>This report includes information your state has on your driving record. Your
                        insurance company will review it because it gives them one indication of how
                        likely you are to file a claim in the future. This report includes your
                        license status, driving class and restrictions. This report also notes any
                        traffic citations (speeding tickets), accidents and convictions (e.g.,
                        driving under the influence.) </p>
                    <p>Having a number of citations and convictions on your motor vehicle report can
                        have an impact on what you pay for insurance. Maintaining a clean driving
                        record is one factor that could keep your auto insurance costs down.</p>
                    <h2>Multi-policy discount</h2>
                    <p>A multi-policy discount may be available when you buy more than one insurance
                        policy from the same company. ERIE offers many <a

                            options</a>&nbsp;that could qualify you for a money saving, multi-policy
                        discount.</p>
                    <h2>No-fault insurance</h2>
                    <p><a href="/blog/no-fault-insurance" tabindex="0">No-fault insurance</a> can
                        help pay for a covered loss regardless of who is found at fault. No-fault
                        insurance is sometimes referred to as personal injury protection insurance
                        (PIP) and may not be available in all states. </p>
                    <h2>Perils</h2>
                    <p>Perils are potential events that can cause a loss, such as fire or a
                        break-in. Your insurance policy contains a list of covered perils.</p>
                    <h2>Premium</h2>
                    <p>The premium is the amount you pay to keep your insurance coverage in effect. </p>
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p>The policy is the written agreement between you and the auto insurance
                        company. This document details what is covered by your policy (see: “covered
                        loss”) and what isn’t covered by your policy (see: “exclusions”). It also
                        details what your premium costs are. If you have questions about your policy
                        and what it covers, be sure and talk to your agent. </p>
                    <h2>Rate</h2>
                    <p>Insurance rates are based on what an insurance company believes they’ll need
                        to pay out in claims to provide security for their customers. Every company
                        determines its rates differently based on multiple factors that are highly
                        individualized. An insurance agent can help you compare rates and features
                        to make sure you are getting the best car, home, business or life insurance
                        to meet your needs. </p>
                    <h2>Risk</h2>
                    <p>An insurance risk is a threat that an insurance company agrees to insure
                        against in the policy documentation.</p>
                    <h2>Road service</h2>
                    <p>Breakdowns, lockouts, flat tires, dead batteries — these are all situations
                        that can keep you from getting where you need to be. If you add road service
                        protection to your auto insurance policy, help is just a phone call away.
                        With it, you can get a tow, a battery jump, help with your tires, gas
                        delivery and more. </p>
                    <h2>Subrogation</h2>
                    <p>Subrogation protects you and your insurer from paying for losses that aren’t
                        your fault. It allows your insurer to recoup costs from the at-fault party,
                        including your deductible, if the accident wasn’t your fault. </p>
                    <h2>Term</h2>
                    <p>A term is the amount of time you’ll be covered by your auto, home, business
                        or life policy. </p>
                    <h2>Total loss</h2>
                    <p>A car is generally considered a <a href="/blog/totaled-car" tabindex="0"
                            >total loss</a>&nbsp;when the actual cash value at the time of the loss
                        exceeds the cost of the vehicle’s repair plus its salvage value. Appraisers
                        will estimate the costs of repairs using factors that may differ by state. </p>
                    <h2>Umbrella</h2>
                    <p>A personal umbrella policy provides an extra layer of liability protection.
                        It provides an additional $1 million coverage (up to $5 million available)
                        for you and your eligible family members against lawsuits arising from
                        personal injury or property damage claims.</p>
                    <h2>Underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage</h2>
                    <p>Let’s say you’re hurt in an automobile accident that was caused by another
                        driver. Ideally, their bodily injury liability policy would have you
                        covered. But what happens if the driver’s policy limits are not high enough
                        to cover the damages to your car, or your injuries? That’s where your <a

                            tabindex="0">underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage</a>&nbsp;kicks
                        in.</p>
                    <h2>Uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage</h2>
                    <p>Similar to underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage, this coverage comes
                        into play when you’re injured in an auto accident caused by someone else.
                        The difference is that the driver either has no insurance or committed a
                        hit-and-run. Because they were at fault and have no insurance to help cover
                        your medical expenses, <a
                            href="/insurance-dictionary/uninsured-underinsured-motorist"
                            tabindex="0">uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage</a>&nbsp;protects
                        you from having to pay those expenses out of pocket.</p>
                    <h2>Underwriting</h2>
                    <p>Underwriting is how an insurance company evaluates its risk of insuring a
                        home, car, driver or person. After looking at the risks involved, an
                        insurance underwriter will set the insurance premium that will be charged in
                        exchange for providing coverage.</p>
                    <h2>Vehicle identification number (VIN)</h2>
                    <p>The vehicle identification number is your car’s serial number. It has 17
                        characters containing numbers and letters and it’s assigned by the
                        manufacturer. This code reveals information about your car’s make, model and
                        year. You can locate your vehicle’s VIN in a number of places: on the
                        dashboard, printed on the sticker inside your door jamb, on your title
                        documents and on your auto insurance policy.</p>
