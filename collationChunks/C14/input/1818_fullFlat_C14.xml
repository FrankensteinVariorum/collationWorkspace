   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1"/>W<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1_hi1"/>E<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1_hi1"/> passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the
            trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
            witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of
            justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether the result of my
            curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a
            smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with
            every aggravation of in<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_173" n="161"/>famy that could make the
            murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities
            which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious
            grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of
            the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a
            declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have
            exculpated her who suffered through me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p2"/>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
            always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
            Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and
            execrated by thousands; for all the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_174" n="162"/>kindness which
            her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
            by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil,
            yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been
            adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
            When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we
            were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered
            herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p3"/>The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several
            witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have
            staggered any one <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_175" n="163"/>who had not such proof of her
            innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been
            committed, and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the
            spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her
            what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused and
            unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o’clock; and when one
            inquired where she had passed the night, she replied, that she had been looking for the
            child, and demanded earnestly, if any thing had been heard concerning him. When shewn
            the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The
            picture was then produced, which the servant had found in her pocket; and when
            Elizabeth, in <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_176" n="164"/>a faltering voice, proved that it
            was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his
            neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p4"/>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had
            altered. Surprise, horror, and misery, were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled
            with her tears; but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke
            in an audible although variable voice:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p5"/>“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my
            protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of
            the facts which have been adduced against me; and I hope the character I have always
            borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation, where <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_177" n="165"/>any circumstance appears doubtful or
            suspicious.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p6"/>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of
            the night on which the murder had been committed, at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a
            village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock,
            she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She
            was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates
            of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn
            belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
            known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might again
            endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_178" n="166"/>where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been
            bewildered when questioned by the market-woman, was not surprising, since she had passed
            a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the
            picture she could give no account.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p7"/>“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance
            weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my
            utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it
            might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have
            no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.
            Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_179" n="167"/>for so doing; or if I had, why should he have stolen
            the jewel, to part with it again so soon?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p8"/>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg
            permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character; and if their
            testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would
            pledge my salvation on my innocence.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p9"/>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of
            her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them
            timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her
            excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
            although violently agi<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_180" n="168"/>tated, she desired
            permission to address the court.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p10"/>“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his
            sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long
            before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this
            occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
            pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her
            character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with
            her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During all that period
            she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame
            Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness with the greatest affection and care; and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_181" n="169"/>afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious
            illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her. After which she
            again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly
            attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate
            mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the
            evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no
            temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she
            had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem
            and value her.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p11"/>Excellent Elizabeth! A murmur of approbation was heard; but it was excited by her
            generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_182" n="170"/>the public indignation was turned with renewed
            violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth
            spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole
            trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who had (I did not for a
            minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent
            to death and ignominy. I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I
            perceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already
            condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the
            accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse
            tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p12"/>I passed a night of unmingled wretch<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_183" n="171"/>edness. In
            the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the
            fatal question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The
            ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p13"/>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of
            horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words
            cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to
            whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That
            evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it;
            and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence,
            be it ever so decisive.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p14"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_184" n="172"/>When I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly demanded
            the result.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p15"/>“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather
            that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape. But she has
            confessed.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p16"/>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s
            innocence. “Alas!” said she, “how shall I ever again believe in human benevolence?
            Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of
            innocence only to betray; her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour,
            and yet she has committed a murder.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p17"/>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my cousin. My
            father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_185" n="173"/>judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said
            Elizabeth, “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I
            cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p18"/>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the
            further end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on
            seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of
            Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p19"/>“Oh, Justine!” said she, “why did you rob me of my last consolation. I relied on your
            innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am
            now.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p20"/>“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_186" n="174"/>join with my enemies to crush me?” Her voice was
            suffocated with sobs.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p21"/>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not
            one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I
            heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
            assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but
            your own confession.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p22"/>“I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but
            now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven
            forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and
            menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_187" n="175"/>said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell
            fire in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me;
            all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an
            evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p23"/>She paused, weeping, and then continued—“I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you
            should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you
            loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have
            perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven,
            where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and
            death.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p24"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_188" n="176"/>“Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one
            moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, my dear girl; I will every
            where proclaim your innocence, and force belief. Yet you <longToken>must die;</longToken> you, my playfellow,
            my companion, <longToken>my more than sister.</longToken> I never can survive so horrible a misfortune.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>“Dear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep. You ought to raise me with thoughts of a better
            life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of injustice and strife. Do not
            you, excellent friend, drive me to despair.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>“I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and poignant to admit
            of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest Justine, with
            resignation, and a confidence elevated beyond this world. Oh! how I hate its shews and
              mock<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_189" n="177"/>eries! when one creature is murdered,
            another is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing manner; then the
            executioners, their hands yet reeking with the blood of innocence, believe that they
            have done a great deed. They call this <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26_hi1"/>retribution<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26_hi1"/>. Hateful name!
            When that word is pronounced, I know greater and more horrid punishments are going to be
            inflicted than the gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet
            this is not consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in
            escaping from so miserable a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt and my
            lovely William, escaped from a world which is hateful to me, and the visages of men
            which I abhor.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>Justine smiled languidly. “This, dear lady, is despair, and not resignation. I must not
            learn the lesson that <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_190" n="178"/>you would teach me. Talk of
            something else, something that will bring peace, and not increase of misery.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could
            conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The
            poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the dreary boundary between life and death,
            felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them
            together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw
            who it was, she approached me, and said, “Dear Sir, you are very kind to visit me; you,
            I hope, do not believe that I am guilty.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your
            innocence than I was; for <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_191" n="179"/>even when he heard that
            you had confessed, he did not credit it.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those
            who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as
            I am! It removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace,
            now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the
            resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my
            bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy;
            but her’s also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the
            fair moon, for a while hides, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_192" n="180"/>but cannot tarnish
            its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a
            hell within me, which nothing could extinguish. We staid several hours with Justine; and
            it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried
            she, “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter
            tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed emotion,
            “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven in its
            bounty bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>As we returned, Elizabeth said, “You <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_193" n="181"/>know not, my
            dear Victor, how much I am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this
            unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been deceived in my
            reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that I
            could not have long sustained. Now my heart is lightened. The innocent suffers; but she
            whom I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am
            consoled.<note resp="FV-Team-rm">Closing quote is missing in this edition.</note>
