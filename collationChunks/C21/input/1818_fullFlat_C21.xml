   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p1"/>“S<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p1_hi1"/>UCH<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p1_hi1"/> was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed
            me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their
            virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p2"/>“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and generosity were ever
            present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene
            where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But, in giving an
            account of the progress of my intellect, I must <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_103" n="099"/>not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the
            same year.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3"/>“One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I collected my
            own food, and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern
            portmanteau, containing several articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the
            prize, and returned with it to my hovel. <longToken>Fortunately the books were</longToken> written in the
            language the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3_hi1"/>Paradise Lost<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3_hi1"/>, a volume of <longToken><hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3_hi2"/>Plutarch’s Lives<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3_hi2"/>,</longToken>
            and the <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3_hi3"/>Sorrows of Werter<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3_hi3"/>. The possession of these treasures gave
            me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these
            histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p4"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_104" n="100"/>“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these
            books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised
            me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p4_hi1"/>Sorrows of Werter<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p4_hi1"/>, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
            story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto
            been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and
            astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty
            sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well
            with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which were for ever alive in
            my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or 
            <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_105" n="101"/>imagined; his character contained no pretension,
            but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me
            with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined
            towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
            understanding it.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p5"/>“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I
            found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike the beings concerning whom I
            read, and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathized with, and partly
            understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to
            none. ‘The path of my departure was free;’ and there was none to lament my annihilation.
            My person was hideous, and <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_106" n="102"/>my stature gigantic:
            what did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination?
            These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p6"/>“The volume of <longToken><hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p6_hi1"/>Plutarch’s Lives<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p6_hi1"/></longToken> which I possessed, contained
            the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far
            different effect upon me from the <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p6_hi2"/>Sorrows of Werter<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p6_hi2"/>. I learned
            from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts;
            he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the
            heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had
            a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and
            boundless seas. But I was <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_107" n="103"/>perfectly unacquainted
            with towns, and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only
            school in which I had studied human nature; but this book developed new and mightier
            scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring
            their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for
            vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as
            I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course
            led to admire <longToken>peaceable law-givers,</longToken> Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus
            and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
            firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a
            young soldier, burning for glory and <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_108" n="104"/>slaughter, I
            should have been imbued with different sensations.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p7"/>“But <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p7_hi1"/>Paradise Lost<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p7_hi1"/> excited different and far deeper emotions. I
            read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true
            history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God
            warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several
            situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I <longToken>was created</longToken>
            apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was <longToken>far different</longToken> from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a
            perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he
            was allowed to converse with, and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature:
            but I was wretched, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_109" n="105"/>helpless, and alone. Many
            times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when
            I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p8"/>“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival
            in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from
            your laboratory. At first I had neglected them; but now that I was able to decypher the
            characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your
            journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these
            papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with
            accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these papers. Here they are.
            Every <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_110" n="106"/>thing is related in them which bears
            reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting
            circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
            and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors, and rendered
            mine ineffaceable. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed
            in agony. ‘Cursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned
            from me in disgust? God in pity made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image;
            but my form is a filthy type of your’s, <longToken>more horrid from its very resemblance.</longToken> Satan had
            his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and
            detested.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p9"/>“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_111" n="107"/>but when I contemplated the virtues of the
            cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they
            should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues, they would compassionate
            me, and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however
            monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to
            despair, <longToken>but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them</longToken> which would decide my
            fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer; for the importance attached to
            its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my
            understanding improved so much with every day’s experience, that I was unwilling to
            commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my wisdom.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p10"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_112" n="108"/>“Several changes, in the mean time, took place in
            the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and I also
            found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in
            amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not
            appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful,
            while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me
            more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it
            vanished, when I beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the <longToken>moon-shine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p10"/> <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p11"/>“I endeavoured to</longToken> crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial which <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_113" n="109"/>in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes
            I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
            dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering
            my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a
            dream: no Eve soothed my sorrows, or shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered
            Adam’s supplication to his Creator; but where was mine? he had abandoned me, and, in the
            bitterness of my heart, I cursed him.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p12"/>“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, <longToken>and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn</longToken> when I first beheld the
            woods and the lovely moon. <longToken>Yet I did not heed the</longToken> bleakness of the weather; I was better
            fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_114" n="110"/>delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds,
            and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
            towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They
            loved, and sympathized with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were
            not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them,
            the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to
            be known and loved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet looks turned towards
            me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they
            would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door
            were never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or
            rest; I required <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_115" n="111"/>kindness and sympathy; but I did
            not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p13"/>“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I
            awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely directed towards my plan of
            introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects; but that
            on which I finally fixed was, to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be
            alone. I had sagacity enough to discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person
            was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although
            harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of his
            children, I could gain the good-will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might, by his
            means, be tolerated by my younger protectors.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p14"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_116" n="112"/>“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves
            that strewed the ground, and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie,
            Agatha, and Felix, departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire,
            was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar,
            and played several mournful, but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever
            heard him play before. At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but, as
            he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
            instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p15"/>“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my
            <longToken>hopes, or realize my fears.</longToken> The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was
            silent in and around the cottage: it was an excellent oppor<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_117" n="113"/>tunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me, and
            I sunk to the ground. Again I rose; and, exerting all the firmness of which I was
            master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The
            fresh air revived me, and, with renewed determination, I approached the door of their
            cottage.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p16"/>“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man—‘Come in.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p17"/>“I entered; ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I, ‘I am a traveller in want of a little
            rest; you would greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before
            the fire.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p18"/>“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey; ‘and I will try in what manner I can relieve your wants; but,
            unfortunately, my children are from home, and, as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find
            it difficult to procure food for you.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p19"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_118" n="114"/>“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have
            food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p20"/>“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I
            remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview; when the old man addressed
            me—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p21"/>“‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;—are you French?’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p22"/>“‘No; but I was educated by a French family, and understand that language only. I am
            now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose
            favour I have some hopes.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p23"/>“‘Are these Germans?’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p24"/>“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted
            creature; I look around, and I have no relation or friend <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_119" n="115"/>upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know
            little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for
            ever.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p25"/>“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but the hearts of men,
            when unprejudiced by <longToken>any obvious</longToken> self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity.
            Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not
            despair.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p26"/>“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately,
            they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto
            harmless, and in some degree, beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and
            where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
            monster.’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p26"/>

            overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for
            many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p31"/>“The old man paused, and then continued, ‘If <longToken>you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale,</longToken> I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind, and
            cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades
            me that you are sincere. I <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_121" n="117"/>am poor, and an exile;

            dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p33"/>“‘Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal; for that can only drive you to
            desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family
            have been condemned, although innocent: judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your

   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p36"/>“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of, or
            bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer
            him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair, and sobbed
            aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to
            lose; but, seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the time!—save and protect
            me! You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of
            trial!’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p36"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p37"/>“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man, ‘who are you?’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p37"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p38"/>“At that instant the cottage door <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_123" n="119"/>was opened, and
            Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on
            beholding me? Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of
            the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father,
            to whose knees I clung: in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground, and struck me
            violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the
            antelope. But my heart sunk within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw
            him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted
            the cottage, and in the general tumult <longToken>escaped unperceived to my hovel.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter14_div4_div15_p38"/></longToken>
