# Collation Chunk-21:

Notes: 
- "plutarchs's lives", the title of the book is weirdly mixed up with other wirtnesses?

Changes:

[] In Manuscript, I moved the element to be on the same line as the letter
- ```I &lt;lb n="c57-0038__main__20"/&gt;&lt;mod
    sID="c57-0038__main__d4e6490"/&gt; &lt;mdel&gt;e&lt;/mdel&gt; &lt;sga-add
    place="intralinear" sID="c57-0038__main__d4e6494"/&gt;i
    ```
    
[] app has &lt; three reading witnesses, BUT looks valid  to the according files. Wrapped longToken around "to the beings concerning whom I" in according editions
- ```xml
    <rdgGrp n="['to']">
	   <rdg wit="f1823">to</rdg>
	   <rdg wit="f1831">to</rdg>
	</rdgGrp>
	```
