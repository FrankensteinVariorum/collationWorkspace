   <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p1"/>I <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p1_hi1"/>SAT<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p1_hi1"/> one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the
            moon was just rising from the sea; I had not<longToken> sufficient light</longToken> for my employment, and I
            remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the
            night, or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of
            reflection occurred to me, which led <longToken>me to</longToken> consider the effects of what I was now doing.
            Three years before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose
            unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart, and filled it for ever with the bitterest
            remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I was alike
            ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate, and delight,
            for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of
            man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who <longToken>in all probability was</longToken>
            to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made
            before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
            loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it
            came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to
            the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by
            the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p2"/>Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of
            the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children,
            and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth, who might make the very
            existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right,
            for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before
            been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by
            his <pb xml:id="F1831_v_163" n="147"/>fiendish threats: but now, for the first time, the
            wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might
            curse me as their pest, <longToken>whose selfishness</longToken> had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the
            price, perhaps, of the existence of the <longToken>whole human race.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p2"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p3"/>I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw, by the light of
            the moon, the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me,
            where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in
            my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
            and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress, and claim the fulfilment of my
            promise.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p4"/>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
            treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like
            to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The
            wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness,
            and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p5"/>I left the room, and, locking the door, <longToken>made a solemn</longToken> vow in my own heart never to
            resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was
            alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from <longToken>the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p5"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p6"/>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost
            motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet
            moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze
            wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
            although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly
            arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, <longToken>and a person landed close to my house.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p6"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p7"/>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to
            open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, and 
            <pb xml:id="F1831_v_164" n="148"/>wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a
            cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often
            felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger,
            and was <longToken>rooted to the spot.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p7"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p8"/>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the
            wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me, and said, in a
            smothered voice—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p9"/>“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? <longToken>Do you dare to</longToken> break your promise? I have endured toil and misery: I left Switzerland with you; I
            crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands, and over the summits of
            its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England, and among the <longToken>deserts of Scotland.he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was</longToken> I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy
            my hopes?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p10"/>“Begone! I do break my promise; never <longToken>will I</longToken> create another like yourself, equal in
            deformity and wickedness.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p11"/>“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my
            condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can
            make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator,
            but I am your master;—obey!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p12"/>“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived. Your
            threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a
            determination of not creating you <longToken>a companion</longToken> in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose
            upon the earth a dæmon, whose delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm,
            and your words will only exasperate my rage.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p13"/>The monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of
            anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his
            mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by <longToken>detestation and scorn. Man! you may hate;</longToken> but beware! your hours will pass in dread and misery, and
            soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to
            be happy, while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You <pb xml:id="F1831_v_165" n="149"/>can blast my other passions; but revenge
            remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die; but first you, my
            tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware; for I am
            fearless, and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may
            sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p14"/>“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared
            my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am
            inexorable.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p15"/>“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p16"/>I started forward, and exclaimed, “Villain! before you sign my death-warrant, be sure
            that you are yourself safe.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p17"/>I would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with precipitation. In
            a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy
            swiftness, and was soon lost amidst the waves.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p18"/>All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the
            murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room
            hastily and perturbed, <longToken>while my imagination conjured</longToken> up a thousand images to torment and
            sting me. Why had I not followed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had
            suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the main land. I
            shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And
            then <longToken>I thought again</longToken> of his words—“<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p18_hi1"/>I will be with you on your
              wedding-night<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p18_hi1"/>.” That then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.
            In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect
            did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth,—of her tears and
            endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her,—tears,
            the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall
            before my enemy without a bitter struggle.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p19"/>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if
            it may be called calmness, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_166" n="150"/>when the violence of rage
            sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s
            contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an
            insuperable barrier between me and my fellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should
            prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock,
            wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it
            was to be sacrificed, <longToken>or to see those whom</longToken> <longToken>I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p19"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p20"/>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved, and
            miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on
            the grass, and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the
            preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.
            The sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I
            belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had
            passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rung in my ears like a
            death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p21"/>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which
            had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and
            one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from
            Clerval, entreating me to join him. He said that <longToken>he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was; that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage,</longToken> he entreated <longToken>me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to</longToken>
            leave my solitary isle, and to meet him at <longToken>Perth, that</longToken> we might proceed southwards
            together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my
            island at the expiration of two days.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p22"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_167" n="151"/>Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform,
            on which I shuddered to <longToken>reflect: I must pack up</longToken> my chemical instruments; and for that
            purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must
            handle those utensils, the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at
            daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage, and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The
            remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor,
            and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to
            collect myself, and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the
            instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my
            work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into
            a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and, laying them up, determined to throw them
            into the sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach, employed in
            cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p23"/>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings
            since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with <longToken>a gloomy</longToken> despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I
            now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes, and that I, for the first
            time, saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me;
            the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary
            act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind, that to create another like
            the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness;
            and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p24"/>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket
            aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was
            perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from
            them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with
            shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow-creatures. At <pb xml:id="F1831_v_168" n="152"/>one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a
            thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the
            sea: I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the spot.
            The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the north-east breeze
            that was <longToken>then rising.</longToken> <longToken>But it refreshed me,</longToken> and filled me with such agreeable sensations,
            that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water; and, fixing the rudder in a direct
            position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing
            was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut through the waves;
            the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p25"/>I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the
            sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually
            threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was north-east, and must
            have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my
            course, but quickly found that, if I again made the attempt, the boat would be instantly
            filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
            confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me, and was so
            slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world, that the sun was of
            little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel all the
            tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in <longToken>the immeasurable</longToken> waters that roared and
            buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning
            thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by
            clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea,
            it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought
            of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; all left behind, on whom the monster might
            satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie, so
            despairing and frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing
            before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p26"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_169" n="153"/>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun
            declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea
            became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell: I felt sick, and
            hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw <longToken>a line of high land towards the south.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p26"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p27"/>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured for several
            hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a <longToken>flood of warm joy to my</longToken> heart, and
            tears gushed <longToken>from my eyes.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p27"/></longToken>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p28"/>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life
            even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my dress, and
            eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a <longToken>wild and rocky</longToken> appearance; but, as
            I approached nearer, I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near
            the shore, and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised
            man. I carefully traced the windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at length
            saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I
            resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where <longToken>I could most easily procure</longToken>
            nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a
            small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my
            unexpected escape.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p29"/>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded
            towards the spot. They <longToken>seemed much surprised</longToken> at my appearance; but, instead of offering
            me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have
            produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they <longToken>spoke English;</longToken> <longToken>and I</longToken> therefore addressed them in that language: “My good friends,” said I,
            “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town, and inform me where I am?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p30"/>“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice. “May be you are
            come to a place that will not prove much to your taste; but you will not be consulted as
            to your quarters, I promise you.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p31"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_170" n="154"/>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an
            answer from a stranger; and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry
            countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I <longToken>replied; “surely</longToken> it
            is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p32"/>“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be; but it is the
            custom of the Irish to hate villains.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p32"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p33"/>While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their
            faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed, and in some degree
            alarmed me. I enquired the way to the inn; but no one replied. I then moved forward, and
            a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me; when an
            ill-looking man approaching, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, “Come, Sir, you must
            follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s, to give an account of yourself.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p33"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p34"/>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free
            country?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p34"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p35"/>“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and you are to give
            an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p35"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p36"/>This answer startled me; but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could
            easily be proved: accordingly I followed my conductor in silence, and was led to one of
            the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being
            surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical
            debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then
            expect the calamity that was in a few <longToken>moments to</longToken> overwhelm me, and extinguish in horror
            and despair all fear of ignominy or death.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p36"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p37"/>I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the
            <longToken>frightful events</longToken> which I am about to relate, in proper detail, <longToken>to my recollection.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter20_div4_div20_p37"/></longToken>
