   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1"/> F<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1_hi1"/>ROM<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1_hi1"/> this day natural philosophy, and particularly
            chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole
            occupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which
            modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated
            the acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I found even in M. Krempe
            a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
            physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I
            found <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_091" n="079"/>a true friend. His gentleness was never
            tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good
            nature, that banished every idea of pedantry. It was, perhaps, the amiable character of
            this man that inclined me more to that branch of natural philosophy which he professed,
            than an intrinsic love for the science itself. But this state of mind had place only in
            the first steps towards knowledge: the more fully I entered into the science, the more
            exclusively I pursued it for its own sake. That application, which at first had been a
            matter of duty and <longToken>resolution, now</longToken> became so ardent and eager, that the stars often
            disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p2"/>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that <longToken>I improved ra<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_092" n="080"/>pidly.</longToken> My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the
            students; and my proficiency, that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with
            a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most
            heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I
            paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some
            discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can
            conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as others have
            gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is
            continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely
            pursues one study, must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
              con<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_093" n="081"/>tinually sought the attainment of one object
            of pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of
            two years, I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments,
            which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. <longToken>When I had</longToken> arrived at
            this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural
            philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
            residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to
            my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p3"/>One of <longToken>the phænomena </longToken>which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of
            the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself,
            did the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_094" n="082"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold
            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; <longToken>yet with</longToken> how many things
            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not
            restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined
            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy
            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural
            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost
            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I
            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also
            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father
            had taken the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_095" n="083"/>greatest precautions that my mind
            should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have
            trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.
            Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a church-yard was to me merely the receptacle
            of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had
            become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay,
            and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention was fixed
            upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw
            how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death
            succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the
            eye and brain. I <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_096" n="084"/>paused, examining and analysing
            all the minutiæ of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and
            death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a
            light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the
            immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men
            of genius, who had <longToken>directed their inquiries towards</longToken> the same science, <longToken>that I alone
            should be reserved to</longToken> discover so <longToken>astonishing a</longToken> secret.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly
            shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have
            produced it, yet <longToken>the stages of the</longToken> discovery were distinct and probable. After days and
            nights of incredible labour and fatigue, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_097" n="085"/>I
            succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself
            capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to
            delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at
            the summit of my desires, was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this
            discovery was so great and overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had been
            progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been
            the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world, was now within
            my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I
            had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point
            them towards <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_098" n="086"/>the object of my search, than to
            exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried
            with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly
            ineffectual, light.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend,
            that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be:
            listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am
            reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
            to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at
            least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier
            that man is who believes his <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_099" n="087"/>native town <longToken>to be the
            world,</longToken> than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time
            concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of
            bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its
            intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
            <longToken>difficulty and labour.</longToken> I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a
            being like myself or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much
            exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an
            animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command
            hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_100" n="088"/>undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for
            a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work
            be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in
            science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay
            the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of
            my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began
            the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance
            to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic
            stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After
            having formed this de<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_101" n="089"/>termination, and having spent
            some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in
            the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I
            should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new
            species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
            owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as
            I should deserve <longToken>their’s. Pursuing</longToken> these reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow
            animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it
            impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_102" n="090"/>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I
            pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and
            my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of
            certainty, I failed; yet <longToken>still I</longToken> clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour
            might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated
            myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
            eagerness, I pursued nature to her <longToken>hiding places.</longToken> Who shall conceive the horrors of my
            secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the
            living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with
            the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic impulse, urged me forward; I
            seemed to <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_103" n="091"/>have lost all soul or sensation but for
            <longToken>this one pursuit. It was indeed but</longToken> a passing trance, that only made me feel with
            renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned
            to my old habits. I collected bones from <longToken>charnel houses; and disturbed,</longToken> with profane
            fingers, <longToken>the tremendous</longToken> secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather
            cell, at the top of the house, and separated <longToken>from all the</longToken> other apartments by a gallery
            and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
            their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the
            slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn <longToken>with
            loathing from my occupation,</longToken> whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually
            increased, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_104" n="092"/>I brought my work <longToken>near to</longToken> a
            conclusion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p10"/>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It
            was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or
            the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of
            nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
            to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so
            long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the words of my
            father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will think of us with
            affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me, if I regard any
            interruption in your correspondence as a proof <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_105" n="093"/>that your other duties are equally neglected.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p11"/>I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings; but I could not tear my
            thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible
            hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my
            feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my
            nature, should be completed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p12"/>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice, or
            faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I
            should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to
            preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
            disturb his tranquillity. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_106" n="094"/>I do not think that the
            pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply
            yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those
            simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly
            unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always
            observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of
            his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Cæsar would have spared his
            country; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico
            and Peru had not been destroyed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p13"/>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale; and your
            looks remind me to proceed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/>My father made no reproach in his <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_107" n="095"/>letters; and
            only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than
            before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch
            the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme
            delight, so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had
            <longToken>withered before my work drew near to</longToken> a close; and now every day shewed me more plainly
            how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
            rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade,
            than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night <longToken>I was oppressed by a
            slow</longToken> fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; <longToken>a disease that I regretted
            the more because I had hitherto en<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_108" n="096"/>joyed most
            excellent health, and had always boasted of the firmness of my nerves. But</longToken> I believed
  that exercise and amusement would soon drive away <longToken>such symptoms;</longToken> and I promised myself
            both of these, when my creation should be complete.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/>
