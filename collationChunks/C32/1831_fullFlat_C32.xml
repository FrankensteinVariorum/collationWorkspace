   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p39"/>August 26th, 17—.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p39"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p40"/>Y<hi sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p40_hi1"/>OU<hi eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p40_hi1"/> have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and <longToken>do
          you not</longToken> feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?
          Sometimes, <longToken>seized with sudden agony,</longToken> he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice
          broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine
          and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and
          quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones, and
          related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of
          agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an
          expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p40"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p41"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1831_v_205" n="189"/>His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of
          the simplest truth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed
          me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater
          conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and
          connected. <longToken>Such a monster has then really existence! I</longToken> cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in
          surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain <longToken>from Frankenstein the particulars
                 of his creature’s formation: but on this point he was impenetrable.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p41"/><p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p42"/>“Are you mad, my friend?”</longToken> said he; “or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?
          Would you also create for yourself <longToken>and the world a demoniacal enemy?</longToken> Peace, peace! learn
          my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p42"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p43"/>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them,
          and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving
          the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved
          my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
          posterity.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p43"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p44"/>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever
          imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the
          interest for my guest, which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle manners, have
          created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute
          of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! <longToken>the only joy that he</longToken> can now know will be
          when he <longToken>composes his shattered spirit</longToken> to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the
          offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes, that, when in dreams he holds converse
          with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries, or
          excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his <longToken>fancy, but the beings
          themselves</longToken> who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity
          to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p44"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p45"/>Our conversations are not always confined to his own <pb xml:id="F1831_v_206" n="190"/>history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded
          knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching;
          nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or endeavours to move the
          passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the
          days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his
          own worth, and the greatness of his fall.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p45"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p46"/>“When younger,” said he, <longToken>“I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.</longToken> My
          feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for
          illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when
          others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief
          those talents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I
          had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could
          not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me
          in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my
          speculations and hopes are as nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence,
          I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my <longToken>powers of analysis and
          application</longToken> were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and
          executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries
          while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers,
          now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes
          and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was,
          you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my
          heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p46"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p47"/><longToken>Must I then lose this</longToken> admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who
          would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one;
          but, I fear, I have gained him only to <pb xml:id="F1831_v_207" n="191"/>know his value,
          and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p47"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p48"/>“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch;
          but when you speak of new ties, and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those
          who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was; or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
          where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of
          our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly any later friend
          can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards
          modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain
          conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless
          indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing,
          when another friend, however strongly he may be <longToken>attached, may, in spite of himself, be</longToken>
          contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and
          association, but from their <longToken>own merits; and</longToken> wherever I am, the soothing voice of my
          Elizabeth, and the conversation of Clerval, will be ever whispered in my ear. They are
          dead; and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
          were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my
          fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must
          pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be
          fulfilled, and I may die.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p48"/>
