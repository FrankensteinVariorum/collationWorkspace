We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.

It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p7"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p8"/&gt; On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?” &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p8"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p9"/&gt; You may conceive my astonishment &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_037" n="025"/&gt;on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. &lt;p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p9"/&gt; &lt;p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p10"/&gt; Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accordingly &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_038" n="026"/&gt;brought him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.
