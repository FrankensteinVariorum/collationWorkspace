   He then put the following letter  
into my hands.  
"To V. Frankenstien  
Geneva  

   Apri

    March

          17—  
"My dear Cousin
   
   "I cannot describe to you the uneasi
   
   
   
   
   ness we have all felt concerning your  
health. We cannot help imagining that  
your friend Clerval conceals the extent of your disorder, for it is now  
several months since we have seen  
your handwriting and all this time  
you have been obliged to dictate to  
Henry – Surely Victor you must have  
been very ill  

    and this makes us very wretched as much so X
   
   
   nearly as t
   after the death  
of your dear  
mother 

    
<zone>c56-0058__left_margin</zone>
    
    . My father was almost  
persuaded  

   of this
    that you were indeed dangerously ill, 
     and could hardly  

    be  re 

   f
    st 
    rain ed  from  

    
   ߶
    
    undertaking 
     a journey to Ingolstadt.  

   I but I entreated him not  to undertake it   because   ^   for      although his health is better now tha  t n   it has been since the death of My beloved Aunt, yet  tha the   fatigue might have  <delSpan anchor="c56-0058.04"/> make him very ill and
   Clerval always wr 

   o
    i 
    te s  that you  
were getting better  

   and
    
   ^
    
   I
    I arden eagerly 
     hope you  
will confirm this  intelligence  soon in your
      own handwriting for indeed, indeed Victor  
we are all very  

   uneasy
    
   ^
    
    miserable on this account 
    . Relieve  
us from this fear and we shall  
be the happiest creatures in the  
world.– My uncles health impro is  
now  

   well &amp;
     far  
     vigorous that he appears  
ten years younger since last  
winter. Ernest also is so much improved,  so   that
      you would hardly know him; he is now nearly sixteen  
you know and has quite lost that 
<zone>c56-0058__main</zone>
   
   
   
   
   sickly appearance that he had  
some years ago – he is quite well &amp; hearty
   if I y may use that term for it is  
very expressive.
   
   "My uncle and I conversed the
   last night a long time about what  

   
   
   
     profession 
    
<zone>c56-0059__left_margin</zone> Ernest  

    should be 
    should follow 
    . His constant  
ill health when young has deprived  

   
   
   
     him 
    
<zone>c56-0059__left_margin</zone>of the habit of application and now  
that he enjoys good health we he  
is continually in the open air on
   climbing the hills or rowing on the  
lake. I, therefore, proposed that  
he should be  a farmer which you  
know cousin is a favourite scheme  
of mine –A farmer's is a very healthy  

   &amp; happy life; and the least hurtful  
or rather the most benificial of any
   profession. 

    
   ^
    
    of any. 
     My father uncle had an  
idea of his being 

    
   ^
    
    educated as 
     an advocate,  

   &amp;
    that 
     through  
his interrest he might become  a judge. But
      besides that he is not at all fit for such an  
occupation, it is certainly  

   better
    more honourable
    
    creditable 
     to  

   to cultivate the earth for the sustenance of man than it to be the  
confid 

    
    a 
    nt &amp; sometimes  

   a helpmate
    the accomplice 
     of  

   
   their
    his 
     vices; which is the employment 

    
   ^
   
   
    &amp; 
    
    
<zone>c56-0059__left_margin</zone>
    
    
   of a Lawyer. And if he should
      become a judge 
<delSpan anchor="c56-0059.05"/> I said that  

   a
   rich
    the occupation of a prosperous 
     farmer  
if it were not a more honourable 
<zone>c56-0059__main</zone>
   
   
   
   
   it was at least a happier employ  
ment than that of a judge, whose  
misfortune it was always to meddle  
with the dark side of human nature  
My uncle smiled and said that I  

   ou g t ought to be an
      advocate myself; which put an end to the conversation  
on that subject
   
   And now I must tell you a little  
story that will please you. Do you  
not remember Ju Justine Martin? 

   
   
    
    Moritz? 
<zone>c56-0060__left_margin</zone>
   Perhaps you do not I will therefore  
tell you her story in a few words. Mad.  
Martin her Mother was a widow with  
four children of whom this Justine  
was the third. This girl had always been  
the favou favourite of her father  

   
   and
   
   
   
    
    but 
<zone>c56-0060__left_margin</zone>
   by
    thro 
     an odd perversity her Mother  

   never could  

   bear
    
   ^
    
    not endure 
     her and after the  
death of M.  

   Martin
    Moritz 
     treated her very ill.  
My aunt observed this, and when Justine  
was ten twelve years old too
      prevailed on her mother to allow her to live  
at our house. 
   X
   
   
   
   X
   The republican  
institutions of our  

   state country, have  
produced simpler  
&amp; happier manners  
than those which  
prevail in the  
great monarchies  
that surround it.  

   Ju Whilst
   Hence there  
is less dis
   
    
                  tinctions
    between the classes into which human beings have been divided, &amp; the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised are more refined &amp; moral. A servant at Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France or England —Justine  was  
                  thus recieved into our family to learn the duties of a servant, which in our fortunate country does not include a sacrifize of the dignity of a human being. 

    
<zone>c56-0060__left_margin</zone>
    
<zone>c56-0060__left_margin</zone>  Where she was taught all the duties of servant &amp; was very  kindly treated. 
<delSpan anchor="c56-0060.05"/> I dare say that you now  
remember all about it, for Justine  
was a great favourite of yours, &amp; I  

   
   remember
    recollect 
     you once said, that 
<zone>c56-0060__main</zone>
   
   
   
   
   if you were a in an ill humour  
one glance from Justine, could dissipate it  

   from
    for 
     the same reason  
that Ariosto gave concerning the  
beauty of Angelica:– she looked so  
frank hearted and happy. My Aunt  

   was very fond of her which
   caused
    concieved an attachment for her, by which she  

    
   ^
    
    was 
    
    
    induced 
   
   her to
   
    
   ^
    
    to 
    
    give her and
      education superior to that which she  

    
   ^
    
    had 
     at  
first intended 

    . 
   and she
    This benefit 
     was fully  
repaid; for Justine was the most  
grateful little creature in the  
world. I do not mean that she  
made any professions–I never  
heard one pass her lips w but  
you could see by her eye that  
she almost adored her protectress.  
Although very gay, and in many respects  
inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest  
attention to every gesture of my Aunt–  
she thought her the  

   miracle
    model 
     of  all 
   
   perfection
    excellence, 
    and endeavoured to imitate her words and even her manners, so that  

    
   ^
    
    even 
     now she very often  

   puts
   
   
   
    
    reminds 
<zone>c56-0061__left_margin</zone>
    
   me in mind of her. 
   You did not observe  
all this, nor did I at the time but  
it struck me afterwards when I  
reflected on the subject. 
<delSpan anchor="c56-0061.07"/>
   
   
   When my dearest Aunt died every  
one was too much occupied in their 
<zone>c56-0061__main</zone>
   
   
   
   
   own grif grief to notice poor Justine  
who had attended her during her whole
   illness with the greatest affection.  
Poor Justine was very ill but other  
tryals were reserved for her.
   
   One by one her brothers &amp; sister  
had died and her mother was now  
with the exception of her neglected  
daugher was left childless. The  
conscience of the woman was troubled  
and she began to think that the  
deaths of her favourites was a judgement  

    sent from heaven to  

   punish
    chastise 
     her partialli 

   n
    t 
    y  
she was a roman Catholic and I believe  
her confessor encouraged the idea 

    
   ^
    
    which she had concieved. 
    . Accordingly, a few Months after your departure for  

   i
    I 
    ngolstadt, sh Justine was called  
home by her repentant Mother. Poor  
girl she wept when she quitted our house  
she was much altered since the death  
of my aunt: grief had given soft 

   e
    n 
    ess  
and a winning mildness to her manners  
which had before been remarkable  
for vivacity. Nor did was her residence  
at her Mothers house of a nature to  
restore her gaiety. The poor fo wo  
man was very vacillating in her  
repentance. She sometimes begged  
Justine to forgive her unkindness 
<zone>c56-0062__main</zone>
   
   
   
   
   but much oftenor accused her  
as having caused the deaths of h her  
brothers &amp; sister. Perpetual fretting  
at last threw Mad. Martin into  
a decline, which at first encreased  
her irritability, but she is now at  
rest for ever; for
    S  she did
      died on the first approach of cold at  
the beginning of th 

   e
    is 
    
   
    
   ^
    
    last 
     winter that  
has just passed 
<delSpan anchor="c56-0063.01"/>. Justine has  
returned to us and I assure you  
I love her tenderly. She is very clever  
and extremely mild &amp; pretty and as  
I mentioned before she
   is her  

   air
    mein 
     and  

   
   
   
    her  
    
<zone>c56-0063__left_margin</zone>expressions are continually
      remind me of my dear Aunt.
   
   
   And I must say a few words
      to you also, My dear Victor, of little darling  
William. I wish you could see him. He  
is very tall of his age with sweet laughing  
blue eyes and dark eyelashes and curling  
hair When he smiles two little dimples  
appear on his cheeks which are rosy  
with health — his chin comes down in a beautiful oval a After this description I can only say what our visitors say a thousand times a day–'He is too pretty for a boy'.   X
   
   
   He has already  
had one or two  
little wives
   but Louisa  

   M
    Caln  Biron  

    is  his favourite–  
a pretty little  
girl of five years old to

   Miss Mansfeld Now, dear
      Victor I dare 
<zone>c56-0063__main</zone>
   
   
   
   
   say I you wish to be indulged in a little  
gossip about your acquaintance. The  
pretty Miss Mansfeld has already received  

   on
   her the congratulatory visits on her  
approaching marriage with a young  
Englishman, John Mebourne
   Melbourne Esq. Her ugly sister Manon  
married M. Hofland the rich banker last  
autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow  
Louis Manoir ma has suffered several  
misfortunes d since the departure  
of Clerval from Geneva b But he  
has atready already recovered his spirits  
and he reported to m be on the point  
of marrying a very lively pretty french  
woman— Mad. Tavernier –She is a widow  
and much older than Manoir but  
she is much adv admired and a  
favourite with every body.
   
   I have written myself into good spirits, dear Cousin yet I can not conclude  
without again anxiously enquiring  
concerning your health— Dear Victor, if  
you are not very ill write yourself  
and make your father and all  
of us happy or— I cannot bear to  

   
   
   think  

   of
